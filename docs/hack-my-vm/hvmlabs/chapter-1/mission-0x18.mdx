# Mission 0x18

## 🔎 Solution
Once authenticated as **clara**, the challenge shifted toward cracking a password-protected ZIP archive containing the next credential.
```

# MISSION 0x18 #
################

## EN ##
The password of user frida is in the password-protected zip (rockyou.txt can help you)
```

To work on the file locally, the archive was transferred from the target machine using SCP:
```
scp -P 5000 clara@venus.hackmyvm.eu:/pwned/clara/protected.zip .
```

With the ZIP file available, the next step was to extract the hash using `zip2john`:
```
> zip2john protected.zip > hash.txt
ver 1.0 efh 5455 efh 7875 protected.zip/pwned/clara/protected.txt PKZIP Encr: 2b chk, TS_chk, cmplen=28, decmplen=16, crc=239F7473 ts=3383 cs=3383 type=0
```

The hash was then cracked using **John The Ripper** with the famous `rockyou.txt` wordlist:
```
> john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash.txt
Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (PKZIP [32/64])
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
pass123          (protected.zip/pwned/clara/protected.txt)

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```

The cracked ZIP password was `pass123`. With that, the archive could finally be accessed:
```
clara@venus:~$ unzip -p protected.zip 
[protected.zip] pwned/clara/protected.txt password: 
Ed4ErEUJEaMcXli
```

That output contained the next user's password. Using it, SSH access to **frida** was successful:
```
ssh frida@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside the account, the next flag was waiting:
```
frida@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===Ikg2qj8KT2bGJtWvR6hC===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===Ikg2qj8KT2bGJtWvR6hC===D~~`
