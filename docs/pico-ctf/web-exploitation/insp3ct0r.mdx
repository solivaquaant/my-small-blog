- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Inspecting the website's source code, we find an HTML comment that contains the first part of the flag.
```html
<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
```
Next, by navigating to the *Sources* tab in the browser's developer tools and examining the contents of `mycss.css`, we uncover the second part of the flag.
```css
/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */
```
Finally, checking the contents of `myjs.js`, we retrieve the last piece.
```js
/* Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: _lucky?f10be399} */
```
Putting all 3 fragments together, we successfully reconstruct the full flag.
