# Mission 0x06

---

## 🔎 Solution
After SSH'ing in as `camila`, the next task was to find Luna's password, which the mission states is inside a file under the `muack` directory:
```
camila@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x06 #
################

## EN ##
The user luna has left her password in a file inside the muack folder. 
```

Listing `muack` shows a large tree of subdirectories:
```
camila@venus:~$ ls -la muack/
total 2212
drwxr-xr-x 551 root root   12288 Apr  5  2024 .
drwxr-x---   3 root camila  4096 Apr  5  2024 ..
drwxr-xr-x 152 root root    4096 Apr  5  2024 1
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Apr  5  2024 10
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Apr  5  2024 100
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Apr  5  2024 101
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Apr  5  2024 102
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root    4096 Apr  5  2024 103
...
```

Because the hint said the password was stored in a file, I searched for likely file contents inside the tree and found a file named `muack` containing the password:
```
camila@venus:~$ cat muack/111/111/muack
j3vkuoKQwvbhkMc
```

Using that credential I SSH'ed into `luna`:
```
ssh luna@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside `luna`'s account I read the flag:
```
luna@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===KCO34FpIq3nBmHbyZvFh===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
