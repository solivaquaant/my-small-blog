# Stego secrets: Extracting embedded files using HxD and dd
During Lab 2 of Digital Forensics course, we explored the topic of **Steganography**. 
As part of the session, our instructor introduced a CTF-style challenge and offered bonus points to anyone who could successfully retrieve the flag.

## Solution
We were provided with a video file and a hint: *"Look for the hex signature of a file that might be hidden inside."*  

To begin, I opened the video file using **HxD**, a hex editor. 
Upon inspection, I noticed that the file header identified it as an `ftypisom` format, which is a common container signature for MP4 videos.  

To search for embedded file signatures, I used the **Search** function (`Ctrl + F`) in HxD. 
Under **Text-string**, I looked for typical MP4 box types like:
```
"ftyp", "mdat", "moov", "pnot", "udta", "uuid", "moof", "free", ...
```
Alternatively, I could switch to **Hex-values** mode and search for hex representations of known file headers.  

After some scanning, I found the following hex sequence:
```
66 74 79 70 6D 70 34 32
```
This corresponds to the ASCII string `ftypmp42`, indicating the header of an **MP4 (version 2)** file. 
This signature was located at **offset `0x1D62C78`**.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./offset.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

To extract the embedded MP4 file, I first converted the offset to decimal: 0x1D62C78 = 30813300.  

Then, using the `dd` command in a Unix-like environment, I extracted the hidden file:
```bash
dd if=video-challenge.mp4 of=output.mp4 bs=1 skip=30813300
```
Opening the extracted `output.mp4` revealed the flag for the challenge.
<div style={{ width: '80%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
This exercise demonstrated how steganographic techniques can be used to conceal full files within other media, and how basic hex analysis combined with known file signatures can help uncover them.
