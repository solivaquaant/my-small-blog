# My little site

Welcome to **my little site**, a personal website built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) - a modern static site generator.  
This site is where I share a bit about myself, write technical blog posts, CTF write-ups, and anything else I find interesting.

## 🌐 Website features

- 🧑‍💻 **About Me** – Learn more about who I am and what I do
- 🔐 **CTF Write-ups** – Walkthroughs of Capture The Flag challenges I've solved
- 🧠 **Blog** – Articles and thoughts on tech, cybersecurity, programming, and more

- 🛠️ Built with **Docusaurus 3** – Fast, responsive, and easy to maintain.
