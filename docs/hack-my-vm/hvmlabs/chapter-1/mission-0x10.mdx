# Mission 0x10

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting via SSH as **isla**, the next objective was to locate the password stored inside the file `passy`. 
According to the hint in `mission.txt`, the correct line starts with `a9HFX`, but those first 5 characters are not part of the actual password.

To search for the required string inside the file, I used `grep`:
```js
isla@venus:~$ cat passy | grep "a9HFX"
WKINVzNQLKLDVAca9HFX
dWeFra9HFXzNQLKLDVAc
kfRgNa9HFXzNQLKLDVAc
zNQa9HFXfEtrgLKLDVAc
WKINVzNQLa9HFXDwErfc
WKINVa9HFXzDcceWeTfd
//highlight-next-line
a9HFXWKINVzNQLKLDVAc
```

Removing the first 5 characters gives the password:
```
WKINVzNQLKLDVAc
```

With the password recovered, I logged in as the user:
```
ssh violet@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once inside, reading the file revealed the final flag:
```
violet@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt
8===LzErk0qFPYJj16mNnnYZ===D~~
```
