# Mission 0x44

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting to the machine as *paula*, the mission file gives a subtle hint related to trust and group membership.
```
paula@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x44 #
################

## EN ##
The user karla trusts me, she is part of my group of friends. 
```

Checking the current group memberships shows that *paula* belongs to a secondary group named `hidden`, which stands out as a potential lead.
```
paula@venus:~$ groups
paula hidden
```

To investigate further, I searched the filesystem for files owned by the `hidden` group. Only one file matched.
```
paula@venus:~$ find / -group hidden -type f 2>/dev/null
/usr/src/.karl-a
```

Reading the contents of this file reveals what appears to be a password.
```
paula@venus:~$ cat /usr/src/.karl-a
gYAmvWY3I7yDKRf
```

Using this password, I was able to log in as the next user.
```
ssh karla@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once inside, retrieving the flag completes this step.
```
karla@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===SARQC95X3AWK9K4BBTMJ===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
