# Mission 0x47

## 🔎 Solution
After establishing an SSH connection as the user `zora`, the next task is to find the password for `belen` located at `venus.hmv`.
```
zora@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x47 #
################

## EN ##
The user belen has left her password in venus.hmv
```

In this context, `venus.hmv` is not a filename but a domain or address. Performing a query to it retrieves the password:
```
zora@venus:~$ curl http://venus.hmv
2jA0E8bQ4WrGwWZ
```

Using the obtained password, SSH into the user `belen`:
```
ssh belen@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Viewing the contents of the specified file reveals the flag:
```
belen@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===FzDIkqJtVgyQYfRVGH1r===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===FzDIkqJtVgyQYfRVGH1r===D~~`
