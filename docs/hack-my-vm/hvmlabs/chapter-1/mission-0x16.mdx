# Mission 0x16

## 🔎 Solution
Once logged in as **natalia**, the next objective was clearly defined in the mission file: find a password encoded in Base64.
```
################
# MISSION 0x16 #
################

## EN ##
The password of user eva is encoded in the base64.txt file
```

Checking the file revealed what looked like a Base64 string:
```
dXBzQ0EzVUZ1MTBmREFPCg==
```

Instead of copying it out to an external decoder, Linux provides a built-in way to decode Base64 using the `base64` utility:
```
natalia@venus:~$ cat base64.txt | base64 -d
upsCA3UFu10fDAO
```
This decoded string turned out to be the password for the next user: **eva**.

With the credential obtained, the next step was to SSH again:
```
ssh eva@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Access was successful, and just like previous steps, a quick check in the home directory revealed the next flag:
```
eva@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===22cqk3iGkGYVqnYrHiof===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===22cqk3iGkGYVqnYrHiof===D~~`
