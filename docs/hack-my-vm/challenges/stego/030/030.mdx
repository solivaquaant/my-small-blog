## 🔎 Solution
The file provided looked like a QR code at first glance, but something was clearly missing - the 3 positioning squares normally found in the corners weren't there. 
Without those markers, most scanners wouldn't decode it.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./og.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

I opened the image in Paint (any basic image editor works) and manually restored the missing alignment squares to match a standard QR structure. 
Once the pattern was complete, the code became scannable.
<div style={{ width: '30%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

After scanning the fixed QR code, the flag was revealed.
