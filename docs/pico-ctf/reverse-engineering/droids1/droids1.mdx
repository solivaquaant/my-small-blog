- **Description:** Find the pass, get the flag. Check out this file.

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The appâ€™s interface remains minimal - just a text input and a single button.
To understand what the app is doing behind the scenes, I opened the APK in [Bytecode Viewer](https://github.com/Konloch/bytecode-viewer) (run with java). 
Inside the decompiled classes, I located the `FlagstaffHill.class`, which contains a method named `getFlag`.
```
   public static String getFlag(String var0, Context var1) {
      return var0.equals(var1.getString(2131427375)) ? fenugreek(var0) : "NOPE";
   }
```
This method is straightforward: it checks whether the input string matches a specific value. 
If it does, the flag is returned. Otherwise, the app simply logs **"NOPE"**.


Rather than reverse-engineering the method logic directly, a faster approach is to inspect the appâ€™s resources. 
Using apktool, I decompiled the APK: `apktool d one.apk`, then navigated to `two/res/values/strings.xml`
This file typically holds static strings used throughout the app. 


There, I found a suspicious value that looked like the expected input.
```
<string name="password">opossum</string>
```
I entered `opossum` into the input field, clicked the button, and... the flag was revealed.
<div style={{ width: '50%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./image.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
