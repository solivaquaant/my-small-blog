## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After opening the pcap file in Wireshark and following the first TCP stream, a conversation between two parties is revealed
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./talk.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
Key points from the exchange include:
1. Instructions for decrypting a file: `openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123`
2. The file was transferred over port **9002**.  

By applying the filter `tcp.port == 9002` and following the corresponding TCP stream, I extracted what appears to be the contents of the transferred file
```
Salted__...<.P...O.r..E~cbk.......p&.}.......
.F
```
Switching the display to **raw** format and saving the output as `file.des3`, I then used the provided command to decrypt it. 
```

```
Running the command successfully revealed the flag within the decrypted file.
```bash
