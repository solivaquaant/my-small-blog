# File types

- **Description:** This file was found among some files marked confidential but my pdf reader cannot read it, maybe yours can.
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## 🔎 Solution
The challenge provides a seemingly broken PDF file that can't be opened normally. 
Suspecting something unusual, I ran the `file` command, which revealed that it was actually a **shell archive text**. 
```
> file Flag.pdf  
Flag.pdf: shell archive text
```
Renaming the file with a `.shar` extension and executing it extracted its contents.
```
> mv Flag.pdf Flag.shar

> sh Flag.shar         
x - created lock directory _sh00046.
x - extracting flag (text)
x - removed lock directory _sh00046.
```

The extracted output was an **ar archive** - a classic Unix archive format that also underpins `.deb` packages. 
```
> file flag
flag: current ar archive
                                                                                                              
> ar x flag  
```
I extracted it, which revealed a **cpio archive**. 
```
> file flag
flag: cpio archive; device 234, inode 37426, mode 100644, uid 0, gid 0, modified Thu Mar 16 01:40:17 2023, 510 bytes "flag"
                                                                                                              
> mv flag Flag         
                                                                                                              
> cpio -i < Flag
2 blocks
```

Following the trail, I continued unpacking each successive format:
* From **cpio**, I got a **bzip2** file
```
> file flag
flag: bzip2 compressed data, block size = 900k
                                                                                                              
> bunzip2 flag            
bunzip2: Can't guess original name for flag -- using flag.out
```
* Extracting the bzip2 file gave me a **gzip** file
```
> file flag.out 
flag.out: gzip compressed data, was "flag", last modified: Thu Mar 16 01:40:17 2023, from Unix, original size modulo 2^32 327
                                                                                                              
> mv flag.out flag.gz
                                                                                                              
> gunzip flag.gz  
```
* Unpacking the gzip yielded a **lzip** archive
```
> file flag    
flag: lzip compressed data, version: 1
                                                                                                              
> mv flag flag.lz    
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
> lzip -d flag.lz
```
* This led to an **LZ4** file
```
> file flag
flag: LZ4 compressed data (v1.4+)
                                                                                                              
> mv flag flag.lz4
                                                                                                              
> lz4 -dv flag.lz4 
*** lz4 v1.10.0 64-bit multithread, by Yann Collet ***
Decoding file flag 
flag.lz4                       : decoded 265 bytes
```
* Which unpacked into an **lzma** file
```
> file flag      
flag: LZMA compressed data, non-streamed, size 254
                                                                                                              
> mv flag flag.lzma
                                                                                                              
> lzma -d flag.lzma
```
* Then came an **lzop** file
```
> file flag
flag: lzop compressed data - version 1.040, LZO1X-1, os: Unix
                                                                                                              
> mv flag flag.lzo 
                                                                                                              
> lzop -d flag.lzo
```
* Followed by yet another **lzip** file
```
> file flag
flag: lzip compressed data, version: 1
                                                                                                              
> mv flag flag.lzip
                                                                                                              
> lzip -d flag.lzip
```
* Then an **xz** archive
```
> file flag.lzip.out 
flag.lzip.out: XZ compressed data, checksum CRC64
                                                                                                              
> mv flag.lzip.out flag.xz
                                                                                                              
> xz -d flag.xz 
```
After unpacking layer upon layer of compression formats, I finally retrieved a file containing the flag-written in hexadecimal. 
```
> file flag         
flag: ASCII text
                                                                                                              
> cat flag                         
7069636f4354467b66316c656e406d335f6d406e3170756c407431306e5f
6630725f3062326375723137795f37396230316332367d0a
```
Decoding it revealed the final flag.
```
> cat flag | xxd -r -p
picoCTF{f1len@m3_m@n1pul@t10n_f0r_0b2cur17y_79b01c26}
```
A true test of patience and decompression skills (*and I hate it lol*).
