# useless

- **Description:** There's an interesting script in the user's home directory
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After gaining SSH access to the target machine, we noticed a file named `useless` located in the user's directory. 
```
useless: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable
```

Viewing the file's content, we found that it was a simple Bash script designed to perform basic arithmetic operations - 
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division - based on command-line arguments.
```
picoplayer@challenge:~$ cat useless 
#!/bin/bash
# Basic mathematical operations via command-line arguments

if [ $# != 3 ]
then
  echo "Read the code first"
else
        if [[ "$1" == "add" ]]
        then 
          sum=$(( $2 + $3 ))
          echo "The Sum is: $sum"  

        elif [[ "$1" == "sub" ]]
        then 
          sub=$(( $2 - $3 ))
          echo "The Substract is: $sub" 

        elif [[ "$1" == "div" ]]
        then 
          div=$(( $2 / $3 ))
          echo "The quotient is: $div" 

        elif [[ "$1" == "mul" ]]
        then
          mul=$(( $2 * $3 ))
          echo "The product is: $mul" 

        else
          echo "Read the manual"
         
        fi
fi
```

Running the script with appropriate parameters yields the expected results of the corresponding arithmetic operation. For instance:
```
picoplayer@challenge:~$ bash useless add 2 3
The Sum is: 5
picoplayer@challenge:~$ bash useless mul 2 4
The product is: 8
```

At first glance, the script appears straightforward, with no obvious vulnerabilities or backdoors. 
However, upon closer inspection, we noticed that when the script is executed without exactly 3 arguments or with an unsupported operation, 
it returns a curious message: **"Read the manual"**.
This is a subtle but interesting hint. 
In Unix-like systems, the `man` (manual) command is commonly used to display documentation about commands, including usage, options, and examples. 
Developers often include a manual page for custom tools or scripts, especially if they want to hide information in plain sight.

So, following the clue, we tried `man useless`, and that's when we found the flag cleverly hidden in the manual page.
```
picoplayer@challenge:~$ man useless 

useless
     useless, â€” This is a simple calculator script

SYNOPSIS
     useless, [add sub mul div] number1 number2

DESCRIPTION
     Use the useless, macro to make simple calulations like addition,subtraction, multiplication and division.

Examples
     ./useless add 1 2
       This will add 1 and 2 and return 3

     ./useless mul 2 3
       This will return 6 as a product of 2 and 3

     ./useless div 6 3
       This will return 2 as a quotient of 6 and 3

     ./useless sub 6 5
       This will return 1 as a remainder of substraction of 5 from 6
