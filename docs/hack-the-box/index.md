# Overview

Welcome to the Hack The Box (HTB) section of my blog!

**[Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com)** is a hands-on cybersecurity platform offering hundreds of virtual machines, challenges, and labs suitable for beginners and experienced practitioners alike. HTB promotes a "learning by doing" approach where you practice real-world techniques in a safe, simulated environment.

Common categories you'll encounter on Hack The Box include:

- 🕵️‍♂️ Web Exploitation
- 🧪 Binary / Pwn (Binary Exploitation)
- 🧩 Reverse Engineering
- 🔐 Cryptography
- 🔎 Forensics
- 🧭 Active Directory / Enterprise
- 🧰 Misc / OSINT / Scripting

### Why Hack The Box?

Hack The Box provides a wide range of practical exercises - from Jeopardy-style machines (Machines & Challenges) to enterprise-scale labs (Fortresses, Endgames, Pro Labs). It's ideal for those who want to:

- Improve practical offensive security skills.
- Learn the full process of finding vulnerabilities, exploiting them, and maintaining access.
- Prepare for roles in red teaming or penetration testing.

HTB also has a large community, numerous write-ups and walkthroughs, and HTB Academy - a structured course library for more formal learning.

### What you'll find here

In this section I share my personal write-ups and solutions for HTB machines and challenges. Each write-up explains not only **how** I solved the problem, but also **why** I chose the approach - the goal is to help you understand the investigative process: where to look, how to analyze findings, and how to craft an exploit.

Write-ups will be organized into: Machines, Challenges, Active Directory, Forensics, and lab series (e.g., Endgames, Pro Labs).
