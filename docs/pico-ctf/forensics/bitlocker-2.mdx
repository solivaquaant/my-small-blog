# Bitlocker-2

- **Description:** Jacky has learnt about the importance of strong passwords and made sure to encrypt the BitLocker drive with a very long and complex password. We managed to capture the RAM while this drive was opened however. 
See if you can break through the encryption!
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The simplest way to tackle challenges involving memory dump files is to run the strings command and search for the keyword **picoCTF** -
this often leads directly to the flag.
```
> strings memdump.mem| grep "picoCTF"                
picoCTF{B1tl0ck3r_dr1v3_d3crypt3d_9029ae5b}
```

Alternatively, you can take a more advanced approach by analyzing the memory dump with **Volatility**, 
potentially using it alongside the [BitLocker plugin](https://github.com/breppo/Volatility-BitLocker) for deeper insights.
