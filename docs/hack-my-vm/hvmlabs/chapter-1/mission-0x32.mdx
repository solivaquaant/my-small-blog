# Mission 0x32

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as *veronica*, the next clue hints at something related to command aliases.
```
veronica@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x32 #
################

## EN ##
The user veronica uses a lot the password from lana, so she created an alias.
```

Aliases in Linux are shortcuts defined to replace long or repetitive commands. 
They are stored temporarily in the current shell or permanently in files like `.bashrc`, and can be listed using the `alias` command.

Checking the defined aliases reveals the password:
```
veronica@venus:~$ alias
alias lanapass='UWbc0zNEVVops1v'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```

Using the discovered password, access to the next user becomes possible:
```
ssh lana@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside the user's directory, the flag is found as expected:
```
lana@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===um3Hno2AsjFjuLWsfmDj===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===um3Hno2AsjFjuLWsfmDj===D~~`
