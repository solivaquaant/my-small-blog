## 🔎 Solution
This challenge didn't require any complex tools or deep technical steps - just careful observation. 
With enough focus, the hidden detail becomes noticeable.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

The flag was written in very small text in the corner of the image. 
That's all there was to it.
