# DISKO 3

- **Description:** Can you find the flag in this disk image? This time, its not as plain as you think it is!
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Following DISKO 1 and DISKO 2, we now arrive at the next challenge in the series: DISKO 3.

Upon extracting the archive, we're given a FAT32 - formatted disk image - bootable via MBR, created with mkfs.fat. 
It's around 100MB in size, uses the classic CHS layout, and notably lacks a volume label.
```
disko-3.dd: DOS/MBR boot sector, code offset 0x58+2, OEM-ID "mkfs.fat", Media descriptor 0xf8, sectors/track 32, heads 8, sectors 204800 (volumes > 32 MB), FAT (32 bit), sectors/FAT 1576, serial number 0x49838d0b, unlabeled
```

Mounting the image using conventional methods didn't yield anything useful at first. 
However, after digging deeper, I turned to `binwalk` - and that's when things clicked. 
Using it to extract embedded files, I successfully uncovered the contents hidden within.
```
> binwalk -e disko-3.dd

```

Among the extracted files was one named `flag`. 
A quick inspection of its contents revealed exactly what I was looking for - the flag. Simple as that.
```
> cat flag                
Here is your flag
picoCTF{n3v3r_z1p_2_h1d3_26d4f233}
```

> *Bonus: I tackled this challenge right after it dropped and ended up being the fourth person to capture the flag, hehe*
