# Rust fixme 1

- **Description:** Have you heard of Rust? Fix the syntax errors in this Rust file to print the flag!
- **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🔎 Solution
Begin by extracting the provided archive using `tar -xzf fixme1.tar.gz`.
This will unpack the project directory, revealing the following files: `Cargo.lock`, `Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`

To compile and run the project, execute `cargo run`.
At this stage, the program will fail to compile, throwing three errors. Let's walk through and resolve them one by one:

1. **Line 5** - A semicolon `;` is missing at the end of the statement.
```
error: expected `;`, found keyword `let`
 --> src/main.rs:5:37
  |
5 |     let key = String::from("CSUCKS") // How do we end statements in Rust?
  |  
```
Fixing by adding a semicolon at the end of the line:
```rust
let key = String::from("CSUCKS"); // How do we end statements in Rust?
```

2. **Line 18** - In Rust, to return a value from a function, use the `return` keyword.
```
error[E0425]: cannot find value `ret` in this scope
  --> src/main.rs:18:9
   |
18 |         ret; // How do we return in rust?
   |         ^^^ help: a local variable with a similar name exists: `res`
```
Change the line to:
```rust
// Create decrpytion object
let res = XORCryptor::new(&key);
if res.is_err() {
    return ; // How do we return in rust?
}
```

3. **Line 25** - When printing a variable using `println!`, use `{}` as a placeholder.
```
error: argument never used
  --> src/main.rs:26:9
   |
25 |         ":?", // How do we print out a variable in the println function? 
```
Change `":?"` to `"{}"`
```rust
    println!(
        "{}", // How do we print out a variable in the println function? 
        String::from_utf8_lossy(&decrypted_buffer)
    );
```
After fixing these issues, run the program again. If all corrections are applied correctly, the flag will be displayed.
```bash
> cargo run            
   Compiling rust_proj v0.1.0 (/home/kali/Desktop/fixme1)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.74s
     Running `target/debug/rust_proj`
picoCTF{4r3_y0u_4_ru$t4c30n_n0w?}
```

## ⚙️ Installing Rust
If your system doesn't have Rust installed or cannot build the project, you can set it up with the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl build-essential
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
Once installation is complete, initialize the Rust environment by running:
```bash
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

You can verify the installation with:
```
cargo --version
rustc --version
```
