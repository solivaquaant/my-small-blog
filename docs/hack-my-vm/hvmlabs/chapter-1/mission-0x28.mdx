# Mission 0x28

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting via SSH as *lola*, the next task is to locate a password hidden inside one of the `.html` files based on a provided list.
```
lola@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x28 #
################

## EN ##
The user celeste has left a list of names of possible .html pages where to find her password. 
```

The file `pages.txt` contains possible filenames that may include the password:
```
lola@venus:~$ cat pages.txt 

new-servers
server-updates
SenSage_LEO
1355485668
```

To automate the search, the plan is to iterate through each filename, request `http://localhost/<file>.html`, and only print results that don't return a 404. 
Running the loop reveals the password:
```
lola@venus:~$ while read p; do code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://localhost/$p.html"); [ "$code" -ne 404 ] && curl -s "http://localhost/$p.html"; done < pages.txt
VLSNMTKwSV2o8Tn
```

Using the discovered password, access to the next user is gained via SSH:
```
ssh celeste@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Finally, checking the contents of the target file reveals the flag:
```
celeste@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===TrdsvMy99slFZtd4Cy4Q===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===TrdsvMy99slFZtd4Cy4Q===D~~`
