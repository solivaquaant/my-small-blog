# Mission 0x43

---

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in via SSH as the *mercy* user, the next objective is to retrieve *paula's* password.
```
mercy@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x43 #
################

## EN ##
User mercy is always wrong with the password of paula. 
```

Inside the home directory, there's a `.bash_history` file. 
Since command history often reveals user mistakes, this is a good place to inspect.
```
mercy@venus:~$ ls -la
total 36
drwxr-x--- 2 root  mercy 4096 Apr  5  2024 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root  root  4096 Apr  5  2024 ..
-rw-r----- 1 root  mercy  133 Apr  5  2024 .bash_history
```

Reading it exposes a command sequence showing a login attempt to the next user account, and the password appears to have been typed directly after `su paula`:
```
mercy@venus:~$ cat .bash_history 
ls -A
ls
rm /
ps
sudo -l
watch tv
vi /etc/logs
su paula
dlHZ6cvX6cLuL8p
history
history -c
logout
ssh paula@localhost
cat .
ls
ls -l
```

Using the leaked password, it's now possible to connect as *paula*:
```
ssh paula@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once logged in, reading the file reveals the next flag:
```
paula@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===2pwlvMk65rw81lymKLJE===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===2pwlvMk65rw81lymKLJE===D~~`
