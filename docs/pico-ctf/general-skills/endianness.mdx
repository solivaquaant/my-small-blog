- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge provides a random string, and your task is to determine its representation in both **Little Endian** and **Big Endian** formats.
Start by encoding the string into its **hexadecimal** representation. For example, the string `qlqvt` becomes: `71 6c 71 76 74`.  
In Little Endian, the least significant byte is stored first (at the lowest memory address), so the byte order is reversed. 
The resulting representation would be: `74 76 71 6c 71`.  
```bash
Word: qlqvt
Enter the Little Endian representation: 7476716c71
Correct Little Endian representation!
```
In Big Endian, the most significant byte is stored first (at the lowest memory address), so the byte order remains as-is: `71 6c 71 76 74`.
```bash
Enter the Big Endian representation: 716c717674
Correct Big Endian representation!
``` 
Successfully deriving both formats will bring you one step closer to solving the challenge.
```bash
Congratulations! You found both endian representations correctly!
