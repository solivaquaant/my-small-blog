# HTTP - Improper redirect

- **Description:** Get access to index.
- **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🔎 Solution
We are provided with a website where the entry point is `login.php?redirect`, which is a login page. 
The goal is to access `index.php`, but attempting to visit this page directly simply redirects us back to the login page.

By reviewing the request history in Burp Suite, we can observe that the request to `index.php` returns an HTTP status code **302**. 
More importantly, the server's response to this redirect already contains the flag.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
	<img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
