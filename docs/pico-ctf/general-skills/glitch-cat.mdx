# Glitch Cat

- **Description:** Our flag printing service has started glitching!
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After establishing the connection, we receive a flag string that is partially readable, while the other half appears as characters represented in the form of **chr(hex)**. 
```bash
'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x62) + chr(0x64) + chr(0x61) + chr(0x36) + chr(0x38) + chr(0x66) + chr(0x37) + chr(0x35) + '}'
```

To decode this, we can use a short and simple Python script to convert the encoded part back into its readable form.
```python
flag = 'picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_' + chr(0x62) + chr(0x64) + chr(0x61) + chr(0x36) + chr(0x38) + chr(0x66) + chr(0x37) + chr(0x35) + '}'
print(flag)
```
And here is the flag~
```bash
> python script.py         
picoCTF{gl17ch_m3_n07_bda68f75}
```
