```
Letter:
I am very moved to tell you that I
understood perfectly, the other day, that you still
have an irresistible urge to make me dance.
I keep the memory of your kiss and I would like that to be
proof that I might be loved by you.
I am ready to show you my affection, wholly disinterested and without calculation.
If you wish to see me thus unveil, without any artifice, my soul laid completely bare,
then do grant me a visit and we shall speak as friends along the way.
I will prove to you that I am the sincere woman capable of offering you
the deepest and closest friendship-in short,
the best friend you could ever dream of.
Since your soul is free, while the abandonment in which I live is so long, so hard, and often so painful,
my dearest friend, my heart is heavy;
come quickly and make me forget it.
To love, I wish to submit myself.

Alfred de Musset replied:
When I swear to you, alas, eternal devotion,
Would you have me for a moment change my language?
If only I could, with you, taste true happiness!
I love you, O my beauty, and my pen in frenzy
Lays upon paper what I dare not say.
With care, in my verses, read the first word
You will know what remedy to bring to my woes.

George Sand replied in the same manner:
This great favor which your ardor demands
May perhaps harm honor, but answers to my flame.
```
In Musset's reply, the sixth line contains a clue: *"With care, in my verses, read the first word."* 
This hints that you should extract the first word of each line to uncover a hidden message.

Applying this to Musset's poem yields: **"Quand voulez que je couche avec vous"** - *"When do you want me to sleep with you?"*

Following the same method on George Sand's response, the first words reveal: **Cette nuit** - *Tonight*.

Thus, the hidden answer to the challenge is: **Cette nuit**.
