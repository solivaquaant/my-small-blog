## ðŸ”Ž Solution
In steganography challenges involving image files, it's quite common for data to be hidden at the end of the file. 
By using the `strings` command along with `grep` to search for the keyword **picoCTF**, the hidden flag can often be uncovered.
```bash
> strings garden.jpg | grep "picoCTF" 
Here is a flag "picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y33dd2eEF5}"
```
## ðŸš©Flag
> `picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y33dd2eEF5}`
