- **Description:** I wrote you another song. Put the flag in the picoCTF{} flag format
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge revolves around [**Rockstar**](https://codewithrockstar.com/) - an esoteric programming language (esolang) designed to make code look like the lyrics of a rock song.

Given the lyrics, we used the [**rockstar-py tool**](https://github.com/yyyyyyyan/rockstar-py) to transpile them into Python. 
```
rockstar-py -i lyrics.txt -o script.py
```
Once rewritten, the resulting Python code looked like this:
```python
Rocknroll = True
Silence = False
a_guitar = 10
Tommy = 44
Music = 170

the_music = int(input("Enter the guitar number: "))

if the_music == a_guitar:
    print("Keep on rocking!")
    the_rhythm = int(input("Enter the rhythm number: "))
    if the_rhythm - Music == 0:
        Tommy = 66
        print("Tommy:", Tommy)
        Music = 79
        Jamming = 78
        print("Music:", Music)
        print("Jamming:", Jamming)
        Tommy = 74
        print("Tommy:", Tommy)
        print("They are dazzling audiences!")
        Rock = 86
        print("Rock:", Rock)
        Tommy = 73
        print("Tommy:", Tommy)
        print("Bring on the rock!")
    else:
        print("That ain't it, Chief.")
else:
    print("That ain't it, Chief.")
```
Running the program, we entered the guitar number (`a_guitar`) and the rhythm value so that `the_rhythm - Music = 0` (with `Music = 170`, the rhythm input should be `170`).
```
> python script.py       
Enter the guitar number: 10
Keep on rocking!
Enter the rhythm number: 170
Tommy: 66
Music: 79
Jamming: 78
Tommy: 74
They are dazzling audiences!
Rock: 86
Tommy: 73
Bring on the rock!
```
The program output the sequence of values: **66, 79, 78, 74, 86, 73**. 
These are ASCII codes, which, when converted to characters using [an ASCII table](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code), spell **BONJOVI** - and that string serves as the flag.
