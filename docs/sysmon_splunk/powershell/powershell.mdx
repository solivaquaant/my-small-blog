# Investigating suspicious PowerShell activity

## Overview
*PowerShell* is a powerful administrative tool built into Windows-but its flexibility also makes it a favorite among attackers. 
From fileless malware to encoded scripts, PowerShell is often leveraged in post-exploitation scenarios, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.

In this post, we walk through setting up PowerShell logging in Splunk, simulating suspicious activity using `Invoke-WebRequest`, and detecting that behavior using Sysmon logs and SPL queries. 
Our focus is on identifying anomalous script executions and file downloads that may indicate compromise.

## Execution steps
### Configure PowerShell Logging in Splunk
To monitor PowerShell activity, first create a new index on your Splunk Server: `powershell_logs`
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./index.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Then, on the Splunk Forwarder machine, configure data ingestion by modifying the `inputs.conf` file:
```
[WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational]
disabled = 0
index = powershell_logs
sourcetype = WinEventLog:PowerShell
```
Next, add a file monitor for the PowerShell log file:
```
splunk add monitor "C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational.evtx"
```
Restart the Splunk Forwarder and check on the Splunk Server to see if PowerShell logs are being received.

### Simulate suspicious PowerShell activity
Download a suspicious file from the Internet using PowerShell:
```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://secure.eicar.org/eicar.com.txt" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\eicar.com.txt"
```

## Log analysis in Splunk
### Detect file creation events via Sysmon
To catch new file creations that may stem from PowerShell downloads, use the following SPL query:
```
index="sysmon_logs" EventCode=11 TargetFilename="*eicar.com.txt*"
```
`EventCode=11` in Sysmon corresponds to **FileCreate** events. 
This search filters those events for files with the name `eicar.com.txt`.

**Log from Splunk:**
