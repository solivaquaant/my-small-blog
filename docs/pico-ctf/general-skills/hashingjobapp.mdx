## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge provides a set of plaintext strings, and our task is to convert each of them into their corresponding **MD5** hashes.  
To generate the MD5 hashes, we can use any online MD5 hashing tool ([this one](https://md5decrypt.net/)). Simply input each plaintext string and retrieve its MD5 hash.
```bash
Please md5 hash the text between quotes, excluding the quotes: 'Cary Grant'
