# PW Crack 3

- **Description:** Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too.
There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. 
You can find these by examining the password checker script.
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
By inspecting the source code of the password checker, we can see that this is a Python script designed to validate the correct password and decrypt the flag. 
The flag is stored in an encrypted file (`level3.flag.txt.enc`) and will only be decrypted if the user enters the correct password, which matches the hash stored in `level3.hash.bin`.

The script contains a function `str_xor(secret, key)` that performs XOR encryption on a given string using a key. 
**XOR** is a symmetric encryption method-meaning that applying the same operation with the same key twice will return the original data. 
This makes it straightforward to decrypt the flag once the correct key (password) is found.
```python
def str_xor(secret, key):
    #extend key to secret length
    new_key = key
    i = 0
    while len(new_key) < len(secret):
        new_key = new_key + key[i]
        i = (i + 1) % len(key)        
    return "".join([chr(ord(secret_c) ^ ord(new_key_c)) for (secret_c,new_key_c) in zip(secret,new_key)])
```

The source code also conveniently provides a list of 7 possible passwords. 
```python
pos_pw_list = ["8799", "d3ab", "1ea2", "acaf", "2295", "a9de", "6f3d"]
```
With such a small set, we could try each password manually to find the correct one. 
However, to speed things up, we can write a simple brute-force script that tests each candidate against the stored hash to identify the valid password.
```python 
for pw in pos_pw_list:
    if hash_pw(pw) == correct_pw_hash:
        print(f"Correct password: {pw}")
        flag = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), pw)
        print(f"Flag: {flag}")
        break
```
Running the brute-force yields the correct password: **2295**, which successfully decrypts the file and reveals the flag.
```
> python level3.py
Please enter correct password for flag: 2295
Welcome back... your flag, user:
picoCTF{m45h_fl1ng1ng_6f98a49f}
```
