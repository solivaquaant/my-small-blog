## ðŸ”Ž Solution
In data encoding, we often encounter formats that begin with the prefix "base", such as **Base64**, **Base32**, or **Base16**. 
These are encoding schemes that convert binary data into ASCII text to ensure safe transmission and storage in text-only environments.  
**Base64** is one of the most widely used encodings, commonly found in emails, HTTP headers, and data serialization. 
It allows binary data (like images or files) to be represented in a readable and transferable format.  
In this challenge, you're given a string encoded in **Base64**. Your task is simply to decode it to retrieve the flag.
```bash
> echo "bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1" | base64 -d                                                    
l3arn_th3_r0p35 
```
Make sure to submit the answer in the correct format: `picoCTF{resut}`
