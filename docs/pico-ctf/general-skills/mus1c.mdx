## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge introduces the Rockstar programming language, which was first encountered in the earlier task [**1\_wanna\_b3\_a\_r0ck5tar**](https://solivaquaant.github.io/my-small-blog/docs/pico-ctf/general-skills/wanna_b3_a_r0ck5tar).

The approach here is slightly different because the challenge uses a newer version of Rockstar, meaning we don't need to install the `rockstar-py` tool for code conversion.

Instead, we can use the official [Rockstar online interpreter](https://codewithrockstar.com/), which produces an output in decimal numbers. 
```
114
114
114
111
99
107
110
114
110
48
49
49
51
114
```
Converting these decimal values into ASCII characters reveals the string **rrrocknrn0113r**, which is the flag.
