# PcapPoisoning

- **Description:** How about some hide and seek heh?
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After opening the pcap file in Wireshark and considering the hint **hide and seek**, I searched for the flag using the filter `tcp contains "picoCTF"`.
As a result, the flag was found in packet number 507.

<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

## ðŸš©Flag
> `picoCTF{P64P_4N4L7S1S_SU55355FUL_5b6a6061}`
