## 🔎 Solution
After opening the provided pcap file, we can see that it contains only a single packet. 
This packet is an HTTP GET request to `/statuses/replies.xml`.

By inspecting the packet details, we can extract the HTTP headers. 
Among them is the `Authorization` header, which contains the credentials `usertest:password`. 
This value directly reveals the password required for the challenge.
