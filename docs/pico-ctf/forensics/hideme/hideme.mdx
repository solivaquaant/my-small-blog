## ðŸ”Ž Solution
With the provided image file, we utilized `binwalk` to extract embedded data. The analysis revealed a hidden file located at `secret/flag.png`.
```bash
> binwalk -e flag.png                       

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
41            0x29            Zlib compressed data, compressed
39739         0x9B3B          Zip archive data, at least v1.0 to extract, name: secret/
39804         0x9B7C          Zip archive data, at least v2.0 to extract, compressed size: 2884, uncompressed size: 3038, name: secret/flag.png

WARNING: One or more files failed to extract: either no utility was found or it's unimplemented
```

Upon opening `flag.png`, we successfully retrieved the flag content.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
