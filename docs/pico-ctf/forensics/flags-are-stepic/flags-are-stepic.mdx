# flags are stepic

- **Description:** A group of underground hackers might be using this legit site to communicate. Use your forensic techniques to uncover their message
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## 🔎 Solution
The challenge provides a website displaying flags from various countries.
Upon inspecting the page source, we find a JavaScript snippet that declares a flags array containing objects with country names and the corresponding paths to their flag images.

Among them, one entry stands out: **"Upanzi, Republic The"**. 
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
Unlike the others, this entry includes an additional style attribute alongside the image path:
```
{ name: "Upanzi, Republic The", img: "flags/upz.png", style: "width: 120px!important; height: 90px!important;" }
```
Downloading the `upz.png` image and analyzing it with common forensic tools such as `exiftool` and `binwalk` yields no useful results.

Revisiting the name of the challenge, the term **stepic** appears to be a portmanteau of "steganography" and "picture". 
Following this clue, and with some help from ChatGPT, we discover a Python library called stepic that can encode and decode hidden data within PNG images using LSB steganography.
```python
import stepic
from PIL import Image

image_path = 'upz.png'
image = Image.open(image_path)
hidden_message = stepic.decode(image)
print(hidden_message)
```
A short Python script using stepic was written to decode the image, and as expected - the flag was successfully revealed.
