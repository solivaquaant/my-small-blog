- **Description:** To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. 
Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337?
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The purpose of this challenge is to explore different formats used to represent strings. 
Common encodings include binary, hexadecimal, octal, Base32, Base64, and many others.

After connecting to the server, we are given several encoded strings and must convert them back into readable text.
- For the first string, it is clear that the format is **binary**, since it only contains the digits `0` and `1`.
```
Please give the 01101100 01101001 01111010 01100001 01110010 01100100 as a word.

Input:
lizard
```
- For the second string, the format is likely **octal**, as lowercase letters (`a-z`) correspond to octal values ranging from 141 to 172.
```
Please give me the  163 164 162 145 145 164 as a word.
Input:
street
```
- For the final string, the format appears to be **hexadecimal**, consisting of characters from `0-9` and `a-f`.

To quickly perform these conversions, we can use [this tool](https://kt.gy/tools.html#conv/). 
```
Please give me the 6e75727365 as a word.
Input:
nurse
```
Once all three strings are decoded correctly, we obtain the flag.
```
