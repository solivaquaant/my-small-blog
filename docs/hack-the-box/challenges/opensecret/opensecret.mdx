# OpenSecret

- **Description:** A simple help desk portal where users can submit support tickets. The application uses JWT tokens for session management, but something seems off about how they're implemented. Can you find the security flaw?
- **Difficulty:** Very easy

---

## 🔎 Solution

The challenge provides a page where users can submit issues to the administrator.
When sending the request in a normal way, the application responds with the message "No session token provided".

This challenge is actually very straightforward.
By inspecting the page source, you can notice a small script at the bottom that is responsible for generating the JWT secret key.
Inside this script, there is a variable named `SECRET_KEY`, which directly contains the flag of the challenge.
<div style={{ width: "70%", margin: "0 auto" }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: "100%", height: "auto" }} />
</div>
