# Mission 0x08

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as `eleanor`, the next step was to locate the password for the user `victoria`. 
The mission specifies that the password is stored in a file owned by the user `violin`:
```
eleanor@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x08 #
################

## EN ##
The user victoria has left her password in a file in which the owner is the user violin.
```

To search for files based on ownership, I used `find` with the `-user` filter. 
Redirecting errors keeps the output clean:
```
eleanor@venus:~$ find / -type f -user violin 2>/dev/null
/usr/local/games/yo
```

Reading that file revealed the password:
```
eleanor@venus:~$ cat /usr/local/games/yo
pz8OqvJBFxH0cSj
```

With the recovered password, I connected as `victoria`:
```
ssh victoria@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Then I grabbed the flag:
```
victoria@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===NWyTFi9LLqVsZ4OnuZYN===D~~
```
