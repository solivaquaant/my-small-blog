# Mission 0x11

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in via SSH as **violet**, the objective was similar to the previous task: retrieve a password from a file based on a pattern. 
This time, instead of the line starting with a specific string, the hint in `mission.txt` indicated that the password belongs to the line that ends with `0JuAZ`. 
Those last five characters are not part of the password.

To locate the correct line, I used `grep`:
```
violet@venus:~$ cat end | grep "0JuAZ"
OCmMUjebG53giud0JuAZ
```

The matching line clearly ends with the marker, so removing the last five characters gives the password:
```
OCmMUjebG53giud
```

With the password recovered, I connected to the next user:
```
ssh lucy@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside the account, reading the provided file revealed the next flag:
```
lucy@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===AdCJ4wl8pmbhi770Xbd3===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
