## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After establishing an SSH connection to the target system, we examined the contents of `/etc/crontab` - the configuration file used by the cron daemon to schedule automated tasks in Linux. 
This file revealed the scheduled jobs running on the system. 
Upon inspection, we discovered the flag hidden within the cron configuration itself.
```bash
picoplayer@challenge:~$ cat /etc/crontab
# picoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_7754e199}
```

## ðŸš©Flag
> `picoCTF{Sch3DUL7NG_T45K3_L1NUX_7754e199}`
