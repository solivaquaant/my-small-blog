# PW Crack 2

- **Description:** Can you crack the password to get the flag?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## 🔎 Solution
The challenge provides two files: a Python script and an encrypted file. Our objective is to decrypt the encrypted file.  
Upon running `level2.py`, the script prompts for a password. If the input is incorrect, decryption fails.
```bash
> python level2.py
Please enter correct password for flag: 
That password is incorrect
```

Inspecting the source code reveals a function named `level_2_pw_check()`, 
which verifies the input against a hardcoded password constructed as `chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x65)`. 
This translates to the string `39ce`.  
```python
def level_2_pw_check():
    user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    if( user_pw == chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x65) ):
        print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
        decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), user_pw)
        print(decryption)
        return
    print("That password is incorrect")
```

Rerunning the script and entering `39ce` as the password successfully triggers the decryption process - and the flag is revealed.
```bash
> python level2.py 
Please enter correct password for flag: 39ce
Welcome back... your flag, user:
picoCTF{tr45h_51ng1ng_502ec42e}
```
