## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Examining the contents of `level1.py`, we find that in the `level_1_pw_check()` function, \
the script checks whether the user-provided password matches the string `691d`. 
If it does, the decryption process is triggered.
```python
def level_1_pw_check():
    user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    if( user_pw == "691d"):
        print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
        decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), user_pw)
        print(decryption)
        return
    print("That password is incorrect")
```

Rerunning the script and entering `691d` as the password successfully decrypts the file, revealing the flag.                                                                                                   
```bash                                                                                                                      
> python level1.py 
Please enter correct password for flag: 691d
Welcome back... your flag, user:
picoCTF{545h_r1ng1ng_56891419}
```
