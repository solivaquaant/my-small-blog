## 🔎 Solution
The challenge website provides a form with an input field and a button, requiring a password to be entered.

Inspecting the web page's source code reveals a commented section:
```
<form class="form-signin" action="passcheck.php" method="post">
      <input type="password" name="password" id="password" placeholder="Password" required="">
      <input type="submit" value="Send">
      <!-- isthisthepassword? -->
</form>
```

I entered `isthisthepassword` as the password and clicked the submit button, which successfully returned the flag.
