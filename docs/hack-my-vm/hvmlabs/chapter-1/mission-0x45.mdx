# Mission 0x45

## 🔎 Solution
After gaining access as *karla*, the mission hint suggests that the next password is stored inside an image.
```
karla@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x45 #
################

## EN ##
User denise has saved her password in the image.
```

Since the hint points to hidden data, checking metadata is a logical first step. 
Running `exiftool` on the available image reveals an interesting field under `About`, which looks like a password.
```
karla@venus:~$ exiftool yuju.jpg 
File Name                       : yuju.jpg
About                           : pFg92DpGucMWccA
```

Using the extracted value, it becomes possible to log in as the next user.
```
ssh denise@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once connected, retrieving the flag completes the stage.
```
denise@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===uMXbjLdQde2iQFoWc8zf===D~~
```
