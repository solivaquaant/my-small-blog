# fixme1.py

- **Description:** Fix the syntax error in this Python script to print the flag.
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge focuses on debugging a Python script. When running the program, it immediately throws an error at **line 20: unexpected indent**.  
```bash
> python fixme1.py 
  File "/home/kali/Desktop/fixme1.py", line 20
    print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

Unlike languages such as C++ or JavaScript, which use curly braces **{}** to define code blocks, 
Python relies on **indentation** (tabs or spaces) to determine code structure and nesting. 
This means that incorrect or inconsistent indentation can lead to syntax errors.


Looking at line 20, we notice that the `print` statement is indented even though it's not inside any function, loop, or conditional block. 
To fix the error, we simply remove the unnecessary indentation.
```python
flag = str_xor(flag_enc, 'enkidu')
print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
```

After correcting the indentation and rerunning the script, the program executes successfully - and reveals the flag.
```bash                                                                                                                      
> python fixme1.py  
That is correct! Here's your flag: picoCTF{1nd3nt1ty_cr1515_6a476c8f}
```

## ðŸš©Flag
> `picoCTF{1nd3nt1ty_cr1515_6a476c8f}`
