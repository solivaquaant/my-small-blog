# flag_shop

- **Description:** There's a flag shop selling stuff, can you buy a flag?
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge presents us with a flag shop menu featuring three options:
```
Welcome to the flag exchange
We sell flags
1. Check Account Balance
2. Buy Flags
3. Exit
```
Checking the account balance shows a starting value of `1100`.
```
Enter a menu selection
1
Balance: 1100
```
Choosing the **Buy flag** option reveals 2 purchasable items:
```
Currently for sale
1. Defintely not the flag Flag
2. 1337 Flag
```
1. **Definitely not the flag Flag** priced at `900`, where we can specify the quantity.
2. **1337 Flag** priced at `100 000`, which is initially out of reach due to insufficient funds.

Our goal is to somehow manipulate the balance in order to purchase the coveted **1337 Flag**.

Looking at the provided source code, we notice the following:
- A variable `total_cost` (a signed integer) is initialized to `0` and later calculated as `900 * number_flags`.
```c
int number_flags = 0;

if(number_flags > 0){
    int total_cost = 0;
    total_cost = 900*number_flags;
```
- Since both `total_cost` and the balance are signed integers, the program is vulnerable to **integer overflow**. 
If `total_cost` overflows into a negative value, the comparison `total_cost <= account_balance` will trivially succeed, and subtracting a negative number will effectively increase the account balance instead of decreasing it.
```c
if(total_cost <= account_balance){
    account_balance = account_balance - total_cost;
    printf("\nYour current balance after transaction: %d\n\n", account_balance);
    }
    else{
        printf("Not enough funds to complete purchase\n");
}
```

**Integer overflow** occurs when an arithmetic operation produces a result that lies outside the representable range of the chosen data type. 
For a signed 32-bit integer, the valid range is from `-2 147 483 648` to `2 147 483 647`. 
If a computation exceeds this boundary, the value "wraps around" to the opposite end of the range.

Suppose we try to purchase **4 000 000** units of "Definitely not the flag Flag".
- The computed `total_cost` becomes `-694967296` due to overflow.
```
Currently for sale
1. Defintely not the flag Flag
2. 1337 Flag
1
These knockoff Flags cost 900 each, enter desired quantity
4000000

The final cost is: -694967296

Your current balance after transaction: 694968396
```
- The program then updates the balance as:
```
account_balance = account_balance - total_cost
= 1100 - (-694967296)
= 694968396
```
With nearly 695 million in our account, we can now afford the **1337 Flag** and successfully obtain the challenge flag.
```
1337 flags cost 100000 dollars, and we only have 1 in stock
Enter 1 to buy one
1
YOUR FLAG IS: picoCTF{m0n3y_bag5_65d67a74}
