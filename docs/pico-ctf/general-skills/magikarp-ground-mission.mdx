# Magikarp Ground Mission

- **Description:** Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After connecting via SSH, running the `ls` command reveals two files: `1of3.flag.txt` and `instructions-to-2of3.txt`. 
Viewing the first file gives us the first part of the flag, while the second file provides instructions on how to locate the next part.
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
1of3.flag.txt  instructions-to-2of3.txt
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 1of3.flag.txt 
picoCTF{xxsh_
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat instructions-to-2of3.txt 
Next, go to the root of all things, more succinctly `/`
```

Following the instructions, we navigate to the root directory `/`, where a similar file is found, containing the second part of the flag.
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd /
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
2of3.flag.txt  boot  etc   instructions-to-3of3.txt  lib64  mnt  proc  run   srv  tmp  var
bin            dev   home  lib                       media  opt  root  sbin  sys  usr
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 2of3.flag.txt 
0ut_0f_\/\/4t3r_
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat instructions-to-3of3.txt 
Lastly, ctf-player, go home... more succinctly `~`
```

Continuing as directed, we move to the home directory `~`, where we obtain the final piece of the flag.
```bash
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cd ~
ctf-player@pico-chall$ ls
3of3.flag.txt  drop-in
ctf-player@pico-chall$ cat 3of3.flag.txt 
c1754242}
```
Combining all 3 parts gives us the complete flag.
