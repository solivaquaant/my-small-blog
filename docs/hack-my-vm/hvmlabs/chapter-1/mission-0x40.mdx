# Mission 0x40

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting via SSH as **adela**, the next objective pointed toward something that could be "listened to":
```
adela@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x40 #
################

## EN ##
User sky has saved her password to something that can be listened to.
```

In the directory, a file named `wtf` seemed like the obvious lead. Opening it revealed a familiar pattern-Morse code:
```
adela@venus:~$ cat wtf 
.--. .- .--. .- .--. .- .-. .- -.. .. ... .
```

Decoding the sequence produced the plaintext password:
```
papaparadise
```

With that, the next login was possible:
```
ssh sky@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside the home directory, the final file contained the flag:
```
sky@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===8T2IE4fNIvbs8sh1lnew===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===8T2IE4fNIvbs8sh1lnew===D~~`
