# Transformation

- **Description:** I wonder what this really is...
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## 🔎 Solution
The challenge provides an encoded file and a short snippet of Python code:
```python
''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])
```
This code is used to encode the original flag using the following logic:
- The input string flag is split into pairs of characters (2 characters at a time).
- For each pair `flag[i]` and `flag[i+1]`, the code:
- Converts both characters to their ASCII values using `ord()`.
- Shifts the first character's ASCII value 8 bits to the left (`ord(flag[i]) << 8`), which is equivalent to multiplying it by 256.
- Adds the second character's ASCII value to it.
- The sum is passed to `chr()`, converting it into a single Unicode character.
- Finally, all Unicode characters are concatenated to form the encoded output.

Once the encoding logic is understood, decoding becomes a straightforward process - we simply reverse each step.

Each character in the encoded string represents a pair of original characters. To decode:
- Convert the character back to its code point using ord().
- Extract the high byte by shifting right 8 bits (>> 8).
- Extract the low byte using a bitwise AND with 0xFF.
- Convert both back to characters and concatenate.

Here's the Python script used for decryption:
```python
def decrypt(encoded_str):
    decoded = ''
    for c in encoded_str:
        code_point = ord(c)
        high = code_point >> 8
        low = code_point & 0xFF
        decoded += chr(high) + chr(low)
    return decoded

with open('enc', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    encoded_data = f.read().strip()

decoded_flag = decrypt(encoded_data)
print(decoded_flag)
```
Running the script reveals the original flag.
