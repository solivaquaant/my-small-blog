# Mission 0x24

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in via SSH as *isabel*, the next objective is to recover the password for the user *freya*.
```
isabel@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x24 #
################

## EN ##
The password of the user freya is the only string that is not repeated in different.txt 
```

The file `different.txt` contains multiple entries, and only one of them is unique. 
The easiest way to extract it is by using the `uniq -u` command:
```
isabel@venus:~$ uniq -u different.txt 
EEDyYFDwYsmYawj
```

The output reveals the password for *freya*. 
With this credential, the next SSH login is performed:
```
ssh freya@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside the new session, reading the final file provides the next flag:
```
freya@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===m1rRSv2pdm3sBGmgidul===D~~
```


## 🚩Flag
> `8===m1rRSv2pdm3sBGmgidul===D~~`
