# HTTP - IP restriction bypass

- **Description:** Dear colleagues,  
We're now managing connections to the intranet using private IP addresses, so it's no longer necessary to login with a username / password when you are already connected to the internal company network.  
Regards,  
The network admin
- **Difficulty:** Very easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge provides a login page, but attempting to access it returns a message stating that access is denied because the user is not connected to the LAN.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./ban.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

From the challenge description, it's clear that only users with *a private IP address* are allowed to access the page. 
This means we need to spoof our IP to appear as if we're coming from a private network.

While we can't actually change our client's IP address in a standard HTTP request, many web applications rely on headers like `X-Forwarded-For` to determine the client's IP - especially when the application is behind a proxy or reverse proxy. 
In such setups, the backend often trusts these headers.

Using **Burp Suite**, we intercept the POST request and send it to the Repeater. We then add `X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.1` to the header.
After resending the request with this header, access is granted - and the flag is revealed.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
