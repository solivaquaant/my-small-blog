# Detecting RDP brute-force attacks
## Overview
*Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)* is a common attack vector for brute-force attempts due to its widespread use in enterprise environments. 
This blog post demonstrates how to simulate an RDP brute-force attack using Hydra from Kali Linux against a Windows target, and how to detect such attempts using Sysmon and Splunk. 
We'll walk through configuring the environment, executing the attack, and analyzing the resulting logs for forensic and detection purposes.

## Execution steps
### Configure the Windowstarget to accept RDP connections
Allow ICMP (`ping`) and RDP through the Windows Firewall:
```
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow ICMPv4-In" protocol=icmpv4:8,any dir=in action=allow
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Allow RDP-In" protocol=TCP localport=3389 dir=in action=allow
```
These commands enable ICMP Echo Request (ping) and allow inbound RDP traffic on port **3389**, which is the default for Remote Desktop.

Check RDP Service Status, if the returned value is 1, RDP is disabled.
```
Get-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\' -Name "fDenyTSConnections"
```

Enable RDP and necessary firewall rules:
```
Set-ItemProperty -Path 'HKLM:\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\' -Name "fDenyTSConnections" -Value 0
Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Desktop"
```
This enables RDP access and ensures firewall rules are active to allow incoming connections.

### Validate RDP port availability from Kali
On Kali Linux, run an `nmap` scan:
```
nmap -p 3389 <victim_ip>
```
If the port shows as open, RDP is reachable. If it shows filtered or closed, RDP may still be blocked by firewall or not properly enabled.

### Execute a brute-force attack using Hydra
```
hydra -V -f -l <username> -P <path_to_wordlist> rdp://<victim_ip>
```
Explanation of the command:
- `V`: verbose output, shows each attempt
- `f`: stop after the first valid login is found
- `l <username>`: username to brute-force
- `P <path_to_wordlist>`: list of passwords to try
- `rdp://<victim_ip>`: target service and IP
This simulates an attacker trying to gain RDP access by guessing passwords for the user.

## Log analysis in Splunk
To detect brute-force attempts, we rely on Sysmon `Event ID 3`, which logs network connections. 
These are essential for identifying repeated unauthorized access attempts to sensitive ports like **3389** (RDP).

SPL query to detect RDP connections:
```
index="sysmon_logs" sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog:Sysmon DestinationPort=3389
```
This query filters for all outbound or inbound connections on port **3389**, the standard port for RDP. 
It's useful for identifying the source IPs attempting RDP access.
