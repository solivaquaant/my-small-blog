# PW Crack 5

- **Description:** Can you crack the password to get the flag?
Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too. 
Here's a dictionary with all possible passwords based on the password conventions we've seen so far.
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The main difference between this challenge and the previous two is that the list of possible passwords is now stored in a separate file, `dictionary.txt`.

Our approach is to write a simple brute-force routine that reads each password from the file, hashes it, and compares the result with the stored hash. 
Once a match is found, we use that password to decrypt the flag.
```python
with open('dictionary.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        pw = line.strip()
        if hash_pw(pw) == correct_pw_hash:
            print(f"[+] Found password: {pw}")
            flag = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), pw)
            print(f"[+] Flag: {flag}")
            break
```

Running the brute-force script reveals the correct password: **eee0**, which successfully unlocks the flag.
```
> python level5.py 
Please enter correct password for flag: eee0
Welcome back... your flag, user:
picoCTF{h45h_sl1ng1ng_fffcda23}
```
