# Mission 0x23

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting via SSH as *lucia*, the next task is to retrieve *isabel*'s password from a file located in `/etc/xdg`.
```
lucia@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x23 #
################

## EN ##
The user isabel has left her password in a file in the /etc/xdg folder but she does not remember the name, however she has dict.txt that can help her to remember.
```

To locate the correct file, each entry in `dict.txt` is checked to see if it exists in `/etc/xdg`, without reading the file itself. 
Only the absolute path is displayed if the file exists:
```
lucia@venus:~$ while IFS= read -r line; do readlink -e /etc/xdg/$line ; done < dict.txt
/etc/xdg
/etc/xdg/readme
```

The file `readme` is present, and reading it reveals *isabel*'s password:
```
lucia@venus:~$ cat /etc/xdg/readme
H5ol8Z2mrRsorC0
```

Using the recovered password, a new SSH session is established:
```
ssh isabel@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Finally, reading the last file gives the flag:
```
isabel@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===Md2CU83GtVfouhm9U0AS===D~~
```
