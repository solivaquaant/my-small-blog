# Collaborative Development

- **Description:** My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they'll work together?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
When working collaboratively on a Git repository, it's common practice for each team member to create and push code to their own dedicated branch.
To list all available branches in the repository, we use the `git branch` command. In this project, in addition to the main branch (`main`), there are three feature branches: `feature/part-1`, `feature/part-2`, and `feature/part-3`.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/drop-in]
â””â”€$ git branch
  feature/part-1
  feature/part-2
  feature/part-3
* main
```
By checking out each branch using `git checkout <branch-name>` and inspecting it with `git show`, we find that each branch contains a distinct segment of the flag.
- Branch `feature/part-1` contains the first part of the flag: `picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_`.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/drop-in]
â””â”€$ git show

Combining the pieces from all three branches reveals the complete flag.
