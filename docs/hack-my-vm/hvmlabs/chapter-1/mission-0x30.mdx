# Mission 0x30

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as *nina*, the next clue points to something hidden behind a local web endpoint.
```
nina@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x30 #
################

## EN ##
The user kira is hidding something in http://localhost/method.php
```

A simple request to the URL doesn't reveal anything useful:
```
nina@venus:~$ curl http://localhost/method.php=
I dont like this method!
```

Since the hint refers to a PHP script related to HTTP interaction, it makes sense to test different request methods. 
Trying POST gives the same response:
```
nina@venus:~$ curl -X POST http://localhost/method.php
I dont like this method!
```

Switching to the PUT method finally exposes the password:
```
nina@venus:~$ curl -X PUT http://localhost/method.php
tPlqxSKuT4eP3yr
```

Using this new credential pair, access to the next user becomes possible:
```
ssh kira@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once inside, the flag is stored in the usual location:
```
kira@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===rJun2WyeuGIvabWQvJko===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
