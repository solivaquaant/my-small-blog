## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge introduces **ROT13**, a simple substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by the letter 13 positions ahead in the alphabet.  
To decrypt the provided ciphertext, we can utilize [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.io/), a powerful online tool that supports a wide range of decoding techniques.
By applying ROT13 decryption using CyberChef, the flag is revealed.
