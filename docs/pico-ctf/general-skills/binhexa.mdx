## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge introduces basic binary operations. 
You'll be given two binary numbers and tasked with performing a series of operations such as **AND**, **OR**, **addition**, **multiplication**, **bitwise shift right**, and **bitwise shift left** - step by step.
```bash
Binary Number 1: 11001000
Binary Number 2: 10010010
```

If you're not keen on doing all the operations manually, you can use [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/math/binary-calculator.html) to perform these operations easily and quickly.
```bash
Question 1/6:
Operation 1: '&'
Perform the operation on Binary Number 1&2.
Enter the binary result: 10000000
Correct!

Question 2/6:
Operation 2: '|'
Perform the operation on Binary Number 1&2.
Enter the binary result: 11011010
Correct!

Question 3/6:
Operation 3: '+'
Perform the operation on Binary Number 1&2.
Enter the binary result: 101011010
Correct!

Question 4/6:
Operation 4: '*'
Perform the operation on Binary Number 1&2.
Enter the binary result: 111001000010000
Correct!

Question 5/6:
Operation 5: '>>'
Perform a right shift of Binary Number 2 by 1 bits .
Enter the binary result: 1001001
Correct!

Question 6/6:
Operation 6: '<<'
Perform a left shift of Binary Number 1 by 1 bits.
Enter the binary result: 110010000
Correct!
```

Once all operations are completed, you'll obtain a final binary result, which you must convert into its hexadecimal representation.
```bash
Enter the results of the last operation in hexadecimal: 190
```
If all operations are carried out correctly and the final conversion is accurate, you'll recover the flag.
```bash
Correct answer!
The flag is: picoCTF{b1tw^3se_0p3eR@tI0n_su33essFuL_675602ae}
```
