## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge provides a simple `.txt` file. 
Upon inspecting its contents, I searched for any occurrence of the string **pico**. 
Sure enough, buried within the text was the flag.
```
> cat anthem.flag.txt | grep "pico"                                     
      we think that the men of picoCTF{gr3p_15_@w3s0m3_4c479940}
```
Sometimes, it's really just that straightforward.
