# Mission 0x37

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as **alora**, the next task was to extract the password hidden inside an `.iso` file.
```
alora@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x37 #
################

## EN ##
The user julie has created an iso with her password.
```

An ISO file is essentially a disk image-commonly used for CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray images. 
It typically contains a full filesystem structure, metadata, and stored files. 
Before mounting it, I checked whether anything readable could be extracted directly using `strings`.

That worked surprisingly well:
```
alora@venus:~$ strings music.iso 
CD001

```

The readable string `sjDf4i2MSNgSvOv` stands out clearly, and based on the format of previous passwords, it matches the expected length and pattern. If mounted properly, the path `pwned/alora/music.txt` would contain this same value.

Using the password, I logged into the next user:
```
ssh julie@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside the home directory, the flag was stored in the usual place:
```
julie@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===Iwe1QpxTcx0A8Uusqjfe===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
