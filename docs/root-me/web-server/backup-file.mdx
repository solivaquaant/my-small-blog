## 🔎 Solution
Based on the challenge name, it is reasonable to assume that it is related to a website backup file. 
Using `dirsearch` to scan for hidden or backup paths, we can discover an endpoint named `index.php~`. 
Backup files are often created by appending suffixes such as `.old`, `~`, and similar to the original filename.
```
> dirsearch  -u http://challenge01.root-me.org/web-serveur/ch11/
  _|. _ _  _  _  _ _|_    v0.4.3                                                                                    
 (_||| _) (/_(_|| (_| )
