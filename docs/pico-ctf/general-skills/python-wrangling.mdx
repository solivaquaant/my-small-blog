# Python Wrangling

- **Description:** Python scripts are invoked kind of like programs in the Terminal... Can you run this Python script using this password to get the flag?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🔎 Solution
The challenge provides three files: `pw.txt` containing the password, `ende.py` which handles file encryption and decryption, and an encrypted file.
Opening `pw.txt` reveals the password: `6008014f6008014f6008014f6008014f`.  
Running the script shows a usage hint:
```bash
> python ende.py         
Usage: ende.py (-e/-d) [file]
```

To decrypt the file, we use the `-d` option followed by the encrypted file's name, then enter the password when prompted.
The flag is revealed upon successful decryption.
```bash
> python ende.py -d flag.txt.en                     
Please enter the password:6008014f6008014f6008014f6008014f
picoCTF{4p0110_1n_7h3_h0us3_6008014f}
```
