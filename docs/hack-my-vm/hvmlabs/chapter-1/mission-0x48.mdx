# Mission 0x48

## 🔎 Solution
After establishing an SSH connection as the user `belen`, the next task reveals that `belen` has obtained the password for the user `leona`.
```
belen@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x48 #
################

## EN ##
It seems that belen has stolen the password of the user leona...
```

However, the current password is not in its original form.
```
$1$leona$lhWp56YnWAMz6z32Bw53L0
belen@venus:~$ cat stolen.txt 
```

Using `john` to crack the hash reveals the password **freedom**:
```
> john --wordlist=rockyou.txt stolen.txt
Warning: detected hash type "md5crypt", but the string is also recognized as "md5crypt-long"
Use the "--format=md5crypt-long" option to force loading these as that type instead

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed. 
```

Using the cracked password, SSH into the user `leona`:
```
ssh leona@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Viewing the contents of the specified file reveals the flag:
```
leona@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt
