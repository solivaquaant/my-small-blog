# Mission 0x15

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as **anna**, the mission hint suggested that privilege escalation was the next step - specifically using `sudo` to become the user `natalia`:
```

## EN ##
Maybe sudo can help you to be natalia.
```

To switch to another user using `sudo`, the syntax is simple:
```
sudo -u <username> -i
```

So applying it here:
```
sudo -u natalia -i
```

The command worked, and the shell switched to `natalia` without prompting for a password - meaning `anna` was allowed to run commands as that user.

Once inside the new account, checking for readable files led directly to the next flag:
```
natalia@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===JWHa1GQq1AYrBWNXEJrH===D~~
```
