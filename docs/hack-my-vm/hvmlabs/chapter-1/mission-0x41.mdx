# Mission 0x41

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting via SSH as **sky**, the next hint pointed toward a web request involving headers:
```
sky@venus:~$ cat mission.txt  
################                                                                                                           
# MISSION 0x41 # 
################ 
 
## EN ## 
User sarah uses header in http://localhost/key.php 
```

Accessing the URL normally didn't return much, but it clearly hinted at a missing HTTP header:
```
sky@venus:~$ curl http://localhost/key.php 
Key header is true? 
```

Since the script expected a specific header named `key` with the value `true`, sending the request again with the correct parameter revealed the password:
```
sky@venus:~$ curl -H "key:true" http://localhost/key.php 
LWOHeRgmIxg7fuS 
```

With the recovered password, the next SSH login was possible:
```
ssh sarah@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000 
```

Inside the user directory, the flag was stored in a familiar file:
```
sarah@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt  
8===nLCR949OMr4pLhMepKCM===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===nLCR949OMr4pLhMepKCM===D~~`
