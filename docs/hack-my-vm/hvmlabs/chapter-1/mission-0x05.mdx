# Mission 0x05

---

## 🔎 Solution
After SSH'ing in as `mia`, the next objective was to locate `camila`'s password which, according to the mission, was left inside a folder named `hereiam`:
```
mia@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x05 #
################

## EN ##
It seems that the user camila has left her password inside a folder called hereiam 
```

To search specifically for a directory named `hereiam` I used `find` with `-type d` (so the search only returns directories):
```
mia@venus:~$ find / -type d -name hereiam 2>/dev/null
/opt/hereiam
```

Listing the target directory revealed a hidden file:
```
mia@venus:~$ ls -la /opt/hereiam/
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr  5  2024 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 4096 Apr  5  2024 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   16 Apr  5  2024 .here
```

Reading that hidden file returned Camila's password:
```
mia@venus:~$ cat /opt/hereiam/.here 
F67aDmCAAgOOaOc
```

With the recovered credential I SSH'ed into Camila's account:
```
ssh camila@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside `camila`'s home I read the flag file:
```
camila@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===iDIi5sm1mDuqGmU5Psx6===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
