# logon

- **Description:** The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
When attempting to log in with the username **Joe**, the application responds with: ***I'm sorry Joe's password is super secure. You're not getting in that way.*** 
This suggests that accessing Joe's account directly is not feasible.  

However, logging in with any other arbitrary credentials results in the message: ***Success: You logged in! Not sure you'll be able to see the flag though.*** 
Upon inspecting the browser's cookies, we notice three key values: `username` and `password` (both reflecting the input we provided), and `admin=False`.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./admin.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
This indicates that the website uses cookies for access control - specifically, to determine whether a user is an administrator. 
This approach introduces a serious vulnerability known as **Broken Access Control**, which ranks among the top security risks in the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). 
Broken Access Control occurs when applications fail to properly enforce restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do.  

In this case, since the admin status is controlled entirely via a client-side cookie, simply modifying `admin=False` to `admin=True` grants elevated privileges. 
After updating the cookie and refreshing the page, we are granted admin access - and with it, the flag.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
