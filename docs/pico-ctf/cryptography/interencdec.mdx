## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Upon inspecting the contents of the file, we quickly recognize that it is a Base64-encoded string.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ cat enc_flag                        
YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclgyZzBOMm8yYXpZNWZRPT0nCg==
```
Decoding it once reveals yet another Base64-encoded string. 
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ cat enc_flag | base64 -d            
b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2g0N2o2azY5fQ=='
```
After a second round of decoding, we finally obtain another string.
However, the output doesn't immediately resemble the expected flag format.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ echo "d3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2g0N2o2azY5fQ==" | base64 -d
wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_h47j6k69}
```

Looking closely, we notice that the structure and length of the string suggest it might be the flag â€” just obfuscated. 
For example, the standard flag format `picoCTF{...}` appears as something like `wpjvJAM{...}`. 
The number of characters remains unchanged, but the letters have been shifted.  

This behavior points to the use of a **[Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)**, a classical encryption technique. 
In a Caesar Cipher, each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of positions down (or up) the alphabet. 
For example, shifting the alphabet by 3 turns A into D, B into E, and so on. 
It's a simple yet historically significant method of encryption.  

Using [this tool](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher), we test various shift values. 
Eventually, with a shift of 7 characters, the scrambled text decodes properly and reveals the original flag.
