## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge presents a website offering a ping service. When a user inputs an address, the site returns the result of executing a ping to that address.
<div style={{ width: '75%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./ping.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

This implies that the backend is likely running a command similar to `ping <address>` upon submission. 
With this assumption, I tested whether arbitrary commands could be injected.

By submitting `8.8.8.8; ls`, the response revealed the presence of a file named `index.php`, indicating that command injection is possible.
<div style={{ width: '75%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./ls.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

To investigate further, I used `8.8.8.8; cat index.php` to read the content of the file. 
The output included the same input field and button seen on the webpage, along with a commented-out PHP code block.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./cat.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Reviewing the commented PHP code, it became clear that a file named `.passwd` contains the flag. 
Using the payload `8.8.8.8; cat .passwd`, I was able to retrieve the flag successfully.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
