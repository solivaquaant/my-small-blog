- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge is relatively straightforward. 
By pressing **F12** to inspect the webpage and examining the elements, you'll eventually discover the flag embedded as the value of a specific class.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./image.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
