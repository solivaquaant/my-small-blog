# Mission 0x46

## 🔎 Solution
After establishing an SSH connection as the user `denise`, the next task relates to the `doas` command.
```
denise@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x46 #
################

## EN ##
The user zora is screaming doas!
```

`doas` is a command in Linux/Unix similar to `sudo`, used to execute commands with the privileges of the superuser (root) or another user.

Checking the doas configuration file reveals that the current user `denise` is permitted to run commands as `zora`:
```
denise@venus:~$ cat /etc/doas.conf
permit denise as zora
```

Using `doas` to execute a bash shell results in obtaining a shell for the user `zora`:
```
denise@venus:~$ doas -u zora bash    
doas (denise@venus) password: 
zora@venus:/pwned/denise$
```

Viewing the contents of a specific file reveals the password:
```
zora@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===hhp0gFTIaedSX3faXDqP===D~~
```
