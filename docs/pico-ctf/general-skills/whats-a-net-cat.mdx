## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge introduces **Netcat**, a powerful command-line utility often referred to as the "Swiss army knife" of networking. 
It allows users to read and write data across network connections using TCP or UDP.  
To connect to a remote service using Netcat, use the following syntax:
```
nc <address> <port>
```

Once connected successfully, the server will return the flag.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 41120
You're on your way to becoming the net cat master
picoCTF{nEtCat_Mast3ry_3214be47}
```
