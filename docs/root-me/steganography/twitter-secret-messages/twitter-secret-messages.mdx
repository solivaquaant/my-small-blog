## 🔎 Solution
In this challenge, we're given a short message that, at first glance, appears unusual - certain characters have inconsistent font sizes and strange visual distortions, almost as if there's a rendering issue.
```
Ｃhｏose  a  jοｂ  yоu  lονｅ,  and  you  ｗіｌl  ｎeｖｅｒ  have  tο  ｗｏrk  a  day  in  yοur  lіfｅ．               
```
With the hint pointing to **homoglyphs**, we're reminded of a steganographic technique where visually similar characters - called homoglyphs - are used to conceal information in plain sight. 
These glyphs look alike but are actually different Unicode characters, making them a subtle yet effective medium for hidden messages.  

By using [this tool](https://holloway.nz/steg/) which is designed to detect and interpret homoglyphs, we uncover the concealed message: **rendezvous at grand central terminal on friday**
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

The solution to the challenge is therefore: **grand central terminal**.
