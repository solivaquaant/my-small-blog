# DISKO 1

- **Description:** Can you find the flag in this disk image?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
First, we extract the contents of the `.gz` archive using the `gunzip` command.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ gunzip disko-1.dd.gz 
```

Since the extracted file is a disk image, we can use the `strings` command to scan for readable text within the binary. 
By filtering the output for the keyword **picoCTF***, we are able to locate and retrieve the flag.
```bash                                                                                                            
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ strings disko-1.dd| grep "picoCTF"
picoCTF{1t5_ju5t_4_5tr1n9_be6031da}
```

## ðŸš©Flag
> `picoCTF{1t5_ju5t_4_5tr1n9_be6031da}`
