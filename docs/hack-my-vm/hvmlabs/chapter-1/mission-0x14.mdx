# Mission 0x14

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting to the machine via SSH as **alice**, the next task was to locate a password hidden inside the `passwd` file.
The mission note made it clear enough:
```
################
# MISSION 0x14 #
################

## EN ##
The admin has left the password of the user anna as a comment in the file passwd.
```

Before diving in, it's important to remember what `/etc/passwd` actually is. On a Linux system, this file stores all registered users along with various metadata required for authentication and environment setup - such as UID, GID, home directory, and default shell.

Each line in `/etc/passwd` follows the structure:
```
username:password:UID:GID:comment:home_directory:default_shell
```

So the goal was to inspect the file and look for anything unusual. 
Running a quick `grep` against the current username revealed something interesting:
```
alice@venus:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep "alice"
alice:x:1014:1014:w8NvY27qkpdePox:/pwned/alice:/bin/bash
```

The comment field wasn't a regular descriptive string - it looked more like an intentionally planted password, very likely belonging to user `anna`.

With that suspected credential, the next move was to attempt logging in as `anna`:
```
ssh anna@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

The login succeeded. From there, the only thing left was to inspect the home directory and check for the final flag:
```
anna@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===5Y3DhT66fa6Da8RpLKG0===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===5Y3DhT66fa6Da8RpLKG0===D~~`
