# HideToSee

- **Description:** How about some hide and seek heh?
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge provides an image hinting at the **Atbash Cipher** - a classic substitution cipher where each letter is replaced by its counterpart in the reversed alphabet (A â†” Z, B â†” Y,...).

Using `steghide` to inspect the image for hidden content, with an empty passphrase
```
> steghide extract -sf atbash.jpg
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "encrypted.txt".
```
We successfully extract a hidden string:
```
krxlXGU{zgyzhs_xizxp_xz00558y}
```
Applying [Atbash decryption tool](https://www.dcode.fr/atbash-cipher) to this string reveals the final flag.
