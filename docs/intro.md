# CTF Write-ups

## Introduction

Welcome to the **CTF Write-ups** section of my personal website - a place where I document my learning journey in cybersecurity through hands-on challenges.

In this section, I share detailed and beginner-friendly CTF write-ups, written step by step with clear explanations of the mindset, tools, and techniques involved.
My goal is not just to present the final solution, but to explain _why_ each step is taken, so that even newcomers to CTFs and security labs can follow along, learn effectively, and build a solid foundation.

The write-ups cover a wide range of challenges, including CTF tasks, standalone machines, boxes, and practical labs from multiple well-known platforms such as **picoCTF**, **RootMe**, **Hack The Box**, **HackMyVM**, **TryHackMe**, and **CyberDefenders**,...

Topics span across common CTF categories such as web exploitation, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, cryptography, forensics, privilege escalation, and defensive security scenarios. Each write-up reflects real problem-solving processes, including failed attempts, alternative approaches, and practical lessons learned.

## Community & feedback

This section is intended to be both a learning resource for others and a knowledge archive for myself, tracking progress and reinforcing core security concepts through practice. Whether you are just starting out or looking to deepen your understanding, I hope these write-ups help you learn, think critically, and enjoy the process of breaking and defending systems.

If you have any questions about the solution to a specific challenge, need clarification on a particular step, or notice something that could be improved, feel free to share your thoughts in the discussion section below.
Suggestions, feedback, alternative approaches, and even requests for challenges you'd like to see a write-up for are always welcome.

I'm more than happy to exchange ideas, learn from different perspectives, and improve the quality of these write-ups together with the community.
Your input helps make this section more useful, more accurate, and more valuable for everyone.
