- **Description:** Investigate an insider threat by analyzing GitHub repositories for exposed credentials, using OSINT tools to correlate online accounts, and performing image analysis to identify locations.
- **Difficulty:** Easy
- **Scenario:** You have been tasked by a client whose network was compromised and brought offline to investigate the incident and determine the attacker's identity.
Incident responders and digital forensic investigators are currently on the scene and have conducted a preliminary investigation. 
Their findings show that the attack originated from a single user account, probably, an insider. Investigate the incident, find the insider, and uncover the attack actions.

## 🔎 Solution
This challenge provides a file named `Github.txt` and two image files.

Accessing `Github.txt` reveals a GitHub profile URL. Visiting [this link](https://github.com/EMarseille99) leads to the user's repository page.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
	<img src={require("./profile.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Searching for `API` within this user's repositories to find potential API key leaks, we find sensitive information in the file `Login Page.js` within the `Project-Build---Custom-Login-Page` repository.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
	<img src={require("./API.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Examining this file's source code reveals hardcoded username and password. 
The password `UGljYXNzb0JhZ3VldHRlOTk=` is Base64 encoded. Decoding it yields `PicassoBaguette99`.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
	<img src={require("./pw.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Additionally, reviewing the user's list of repositories shows they forked the `xmrig` repository, a cryptocurrency mining software.

Using the username `EMarseille99` for further online searches reveals associated Instagram and Steam accounts using the same handle.
<div style={{ width: '60%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
	<img src={require("./name.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Visiting the user's Instagram profile at [here](https://www.instagram.com/emarseille99/) shows a post from May 24, 2020, where the user shared about being on holiday. 
The photo features the *Marina Bay Sands* in **Singapore**.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
	<img src={require("./holiday.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

In the final post on the profile, the user shared about visiting family and relatives. 
The two images in this post can be analyzed using AI tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to identify the location, which is determined to be **Dubai**.

Next, we analyze the provided file `office.jpg`. 
The image contains a sign pointing to the *Hippodrome Theatre Alexandra Theatre*. 
This area is located in **Birmingham**.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
	<img src={require("./office.jpg").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

The final image is a webcam screenshot. 
AI analysis suggests the location: *"Based on the pointed church tower on the right and the campus layout, this appears to be the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, USA. 
The church in the image is the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, a prominent landmark of the university."*
<div style={{ width: '80%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
	<img src={require("./cam.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
