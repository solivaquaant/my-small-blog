- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The goal of this challenge is to demonstrate how to establish an SSH connection to a remote machine. 
To do this, you can use the following command syntax:
```bash
ssh -p <port-number> <username>@<host-address>
```
When prompted with a fingerprint verification (host authenticity), type **yes** to continue the connection. 
Then, enter the correct password when asked. If everything is done correctly, you will successfully establish an SSH session with the target machine - and the flag will be waiting for you upon login.     
For example:
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/drop-in]
â””â”€$ ssh -p 63903 ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net
The authenticity of host '[titan.picoctf.net]:63903 ([3.139.174.234]:63903)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:4S9EbTSSRZm32I+cdM5TyzthpQryv5kudRP9PIKT7XQ.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[titan.picoctf.net]:63903' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net's password: 
Welcome ctf-player, here's your flag: picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_45a48857}
Connection to titan.picoctf.net closed.
```
