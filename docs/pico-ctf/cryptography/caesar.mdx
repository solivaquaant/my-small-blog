# caesar

- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
In this challenge, we are given a ciphertext string.
```
picoCTF{gvswwmrkxlivyfmgsrhnrisegl}
```
Based on the challenge name, it suggests the use of a Caesar cipher. 
The **Caesar cipher** is 1 of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. 
It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

Using a [Caesar cipher decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher), we test different shifts and discover that applying a right shift of 4 successfully reveals the plaintext:
```
crossingtherubicondjneoach
```
This provides us with the solution and the hidden flag.
