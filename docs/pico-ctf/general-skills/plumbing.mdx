## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Upon connecting to the server, a large amount of text is displayed. 
By piping the output through `grep` to search for the keyword **pico**, we can quickly isolate and retrieve the flag.
```
> nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 14291 | grep "pico"
picoCTF{digital_plumb3r_ea8bfec7}
```

## ðŸš©Flag
> `picoCTF{digital_plumb3r_ea8bfec7}`
