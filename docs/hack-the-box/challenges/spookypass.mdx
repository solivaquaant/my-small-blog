# SpookyPass

- **Description:** All the coolest ghosts in town are going to a Haunted Houseparty - can you prove you deserve to get in?
- **Difficulty:** Very easy

## 🔎 Solution
The challenge provides an executable file. 
After granting execution permissions and running it, the program prompts for a password. 
Entering an incorrect password results in an error message stating the user is not a "real ghost."
```
> ./pass       
Welcome to the SPOOKIEST party of the year.
Before we let you in, you'll need to give us the password: hackthebox
You're not a real ghost; clear off!
```

The true password must be located elsewhere. 
Using the `strings` command on the file reveals the string `s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5`.
```js
> strings pass             
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
....
Welcome to the 
[1;3mSPOOKIEST
[0m party of the year.
Before we let you in, you'll need to give us the password: 
//highlight-next-line
s3cr3t_p455_f0r_gh05t5_4nd_gh0ul5
Welcome inside!
You're not a real ghost; clear off!
...
```

Running the executable again and using this string as the password reveals the flag.
```
> ./pass
