# Mission 0x39

## 🔎 Solution
Once logged in as **irene**, the next mission hinted that the password for the next user was stored locally but encrypted:
```
irene@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x39 #
################

## EN ##
The user adela has lent her password to irene.
```

In the home directory, three files immediately stood out-they were clearly related to RSA encryption:
```
irene@venus:~$ ls -la
-rw-r----- 1 root  irene 1704 Apr  5  2024 id_rsa.pem
-rw-r----- 1 root  irene  451 Apr  5  2024 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r----- 1 root  irene  256 Apr  5  2024 pass.enc
```

The presence of `pass.enc` suggested encrypted content, while `id_rsa.pem` was the private key needed to decrypt it. 
Since RSA is asymmetric, the private key is required to turn the encrypted ciphertext back into plaintext.

Using OpenSSL, the encrypted file was decrypted successfully:
```
irene@venus:~$ openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey id_rsa.pem -in pass.enc
nbhlQyKuaXGojHx
```

That output was clearly the password. With it, I could continue to the final user in this stage:
```
ssh adela@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once logged in, the flag was sitting in the home folder:
```
adela@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===86XGXQefUeV2eEdrUzxx===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
