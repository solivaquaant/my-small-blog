# Mission 0x02

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting via SSH as `sophia`, the next task was to locate the password file for user `angela`:
```
sophia@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x02 #
################

## EN ##
The user angela has saved her password in a file but she does not remember where ... she only remembers that the file was called whereismypazz.txt
```

To locate a file in Linux, I used the `find` command. 
Redirecting `2>/dev/null` hides permission-related error messages that would otherwise clutter the output:
```
sophia@venus:~$ find / -name "whereismypazz.txt" 2>/dev/null
/share/whereismypazz.txt
```

Reading the file revealed Angela's password:
```
sophia@venus:~$ cat /usr/share/whereismypazz.txt
oh5p9gAABugHBje
```

I then SSH'ed into the machine as `angela`:
```
ssh angela@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Finally, viewing `flagz.txt` gave the flag for Mission 0x02, ready to move on to Mission 0x03:
```
angela@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===SjMYBmMh4bk49TKq7PM8===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
