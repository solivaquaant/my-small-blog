- **Difficulty:** Very easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge website provides 3 buttons that redirect users to different external websites. \
Upon inspecting the source code, the following snippet is revealed:
```html
<a href='?url=https://facebook.com&h=a023cfbf5f1c39bdf8407f28b60cd134'>facebook</a>
<a href='?url=https://twitter.com&h=be8b09f7f1f66235a9c91986952483f0'>twitter</a>
<a href='?url=https://slack.com&h=e52dc719664ead63be3d5066c135b6da'>slack</a>
```
Each link consists of 2 query parameters:
- `url` - the destination to redirect to
- `h` - a hash value used for verification

By analyzing the pattern, it becomes clear that the value of `h` is simply the **MD5 hash** of the URL. 
This can be easily verified using an online tool such as [this](https://md5.gromweb.com/).

We can reasonably assume that on the server side, the redirection logic works something like this:
```
expected_hash = md5(url).hexdigest()
if h == expected_hash:
    redirect(url)
```

Based on this behavior, we can attempt to redirect to an arbitrary domain by generating a valid MD5 hash for our custom URL. 
In this case, I chose https://www.google.com/. 
The MD5 hash of this URL is `d75277cdffef995a46ae59bdaef1db86`.

Using **Burp Suite**, I intercepted the request and modified the URL as 
```
?url=https://www.google.com/&h=d75277cdffef995a46ae59bdaef1db86
```
As expected, the server accepted the hash and successfully redirected to Google. 
This confirmed the vulnerability, and I was able to obtain the flag.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
