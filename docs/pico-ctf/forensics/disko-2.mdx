# DISKO 2

- **Description:** Can you find the flag in this disk image? The right one is Linux! One wrong step and its all gone!
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Unlike the previous challenge (DISKO 1), attempting to locate the flag using a simple `strings` + `grep` approach proves ineffective here - 
the result is cluttered with numerous false flags and noise, making it difficult to isolate the correct one.

After extracting the provided archive, we obtain a disk image file (`disko-2.dd`) formatted with an MBR (Master Boot Record) and containing 2 partitions:
- Partition 1: ID 0x83 (**Linux**), starts at sector 2048, spans 51200 sectors.
- Partition 2: ID 0x0b (FAT32), starts at sector 53248, spans 65536 sectors.
```
disko-2.dd: DOS/MBR boot sector; partition 1 : ID=0x83, start-CHS (0x0,32,33), end-CHS (0x3,80,13), startsector 2048, 51200 sectors;
partition 2 : ID=0xb, start-CHS (0x3,80,14), end-CHS (0x7,100,29), startsector 53248, 65536 sectors
```

According to the challenge description, the actual flag resides in the first partition. 
Using `dd`, we can extract this partition into a separate file. 
Given that each sector is 512 bytes (standard MBR sector size), the command is:
```
dd if=disko-2.dd of=partition1.img bs=512 skip=2048 count=51200
```

Once extracted, we search for the keyword **picoCTF** inside the image. 
This yields the correct flag among the results.
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/pico-ctf]
â””â”€$ sudo strings partition1.img | grep -i picoCTF
picoCTF{4_P4Rt_1t_i5_055dd175}
```

## ðŸš©Flag
> `picoCTF{4_P4Rt_1t_i5_055dd175}`
