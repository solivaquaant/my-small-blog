- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Similar to the **substitution0** challenge, the provided text is also encrypted with a **substitution cipher**.

Using [an online tool](https://www.dcode.fr/monoalphabetic-substitution) to automatically decrypt it, we obtain the substitution key as `ATZMXDREBLNJIVQCOFGWPYHUSK`.

The original message is then decrypted as follows:
```
CTFS (SHORT FOR CAPTURE THE FLAG) ARE A TYPE OF COMPUTER SECURITY COMPETITION. 
CONTESTANTS ARE PRESENTED WITH A SET OF CHALLENGES WHICH TEST THEIR CREATIVITY, TECHNICAL (AND GOOGLING) SKILLS, AND PROBLEM-SOLVING ABILITY. 
CHALLENGES USUALLY COVER A NUMBER OF CATEGORIES, AND WHEN SOLVED, EACH YIELDS A STRING (CALLED A FLAG) WHICH IS SUBMITTED TO AN ONLINE SCORING SERVICE. 
CTFS ARE A GREAT WAY TO LEARN A WIDE ARRAY OF COMPUTER SECURITY SKILLS IN A SAFE, LEGAL ENVIRONMENT, AND ARE HOSTED AND PLAYED BY MANY SECURITY GROUPS AROUND THE WORLD FOR FUN AND PRACTICE. 

FOR THIS PROBLEM, THE FLAG IS: PICOCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_4871E6FB}
