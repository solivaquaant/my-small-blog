# TELNET - authentication

- **Description:** Find the user password in this TELNET session capture.
- **Difficulty:** Very easy

---

## 🔎 Solution
The pcap file provided in this challenge contains a Telnet connection between `192.168.0.1` and `192.168.0.2`. 
Telnet is a network protocol used to remotely access and control a computer via a command-line interface. 
Its major drawback is the lack of encryption, which means all transmitted data can be viewed in plaintext.

To analyze the traffic more easily, we can use the **Follow TCP Stream** feature. 
From the reconstructed stream, we can see that when the client enters the password `user`, the Telnet connection is successfully authenticated.
