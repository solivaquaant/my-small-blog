## 🔎 Solution
For this challenge, we were given an MP3 file. 
Listening to it, I couldn't immediately recognize the language (I only understand English and Vietnamese).

To make sense of it, I used audio-to-text tools. 
Using [this tool](https://audiototext.com/), the transcription returned:
```
I L O V L A N G U A G S.
```

After correcting it, it reads as:
```
I love languages
```
