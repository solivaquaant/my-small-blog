# Mission 0x07

## 🔎 Solution
After SSH'ing in as `luna`, the next objective was to locate a file that occupies exactly 6,969 bytes - that file contains `eleanor`'s password:
```
luna@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x07 #
################

## EN ##
The user eleanor has left her password in a file that occupies 6969 bytes.
```

I used `find` with the `-size` test. The suffix `c` means bytes, so `-size 6969c` matches files whose size is exactly 6,969 bytes:
```
luna@venus:~$ find / -size 6969c 2>/dev/null
/usr/share/moon.txt
```

Printing the file revealed the password:
```
luna@venus:~$ cat /usr/share/moon.txt
UNDchvln6Bmtu7b
```

With that credential I SSH'ed into `eleanor`:
```
ssh eleanor@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside `eleanor`'s account I read the flag:
```
eleanor@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===Iq5vbyiQl4ipNrLDArjD===D~~
```
