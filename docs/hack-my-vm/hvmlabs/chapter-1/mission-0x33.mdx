# Mission 0x33

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as *lana*, the next objective involves handling a compressed file.
```
lana@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x33 #
################

## EN ##
The user noa loves to compress her things.
```

Inside the home directory, there is a file named `zip.gz`. 
Despite the extension, it's not a standard gzip file - checking its type reveals it's actually a tar archive.
```
lana@venus:~$ file zip.gz 
zip.gz: POSIX tar archive (GNU)
```

To make extraction easier, the file was transferred locally:
```
scp -P 5000  lana@venus.hackmyvm.eu:/pwned/lana/zip.gz .
```

After that, extracting the archive gives access to the contents:
```
tar -xf zip.gz
```

Reading the extracted file reveals the password:
```
> cat ./pwned/lana/zip 
9WWOPoeJrq6ncvJ
```

Using those credentials allows access to the next user:
```
ssh noa@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

The flag is stored in the usual place:
```
noa@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===HUNGevKdeKwcCvJru1CC===D~~
```
