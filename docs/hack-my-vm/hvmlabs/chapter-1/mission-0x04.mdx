# Mission 0x04

## 🔎 Solution
After SSH'ing in as `emma`, the next task was to retrieve `mia`'s password - which the mission states is stored in a file literally named `-`:
```
emma@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x04 #
################

## EN ##
User mia has left her password in the file -.
```

At first this looks trivial, but many Unix utilities (`cat`, `less`, `more`, etc.) treat a standalone `-` as a special token meaning "read from standard input" (stdin), not "the file named `-`". 
So running `cat -` will wait for you to type input rather than opening a file named `-`.

To tell the shell and the command that you really mean the filename `-`, prefix it with `./` (the current directory). That disambiguates it from the stdin token:
```
emma@venus:~$ cat ./-
iKXIYg0pyEH2Hos
```

With the recovered password I SSH'ed into `mia`:
```
ssh mia@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside `mia`'s account I read the flag file:
```
mia@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===FBMdY8hel2VMA3BaYJin===D~~
```
