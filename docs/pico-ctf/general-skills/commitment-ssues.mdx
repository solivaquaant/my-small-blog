# Commitment Issues

- **Description:** I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it!
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Upon discovering the .git directory, we can infer that this is a Git repository. 
Running the `git log` command reveals the commit history, allowing us to trace the author's actions.
From the log, it appears that the author initially committed a file containing the flag. 
A subsequent commit seems to have modified or removed some part of that content - indicating a significant change occurred between the 2 commits.  
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop/drop-in]
â””â”€$ git log 
commit e1237df82d2e69f62dd53279abc1c8aeb66f6d64 (HEAD -> master)
Author: picoCTF <ops@picoctf.com>
Date:   Sat Mar 9 21:10:14 2024 +0000

    remove sensitive info

commit 3d5ec8a26ee7b092a1760fea18f384c35e435139
Author: picoCTF <ops@picoctf.com>
Date:   Sat Mar 9 21:10:14 2024 +0000

    create flag
```
To investigate further, we use `git show` on the later commit. 
This reveals that the original flag content was deleted and replaced with the string **"TOP SECRET".** 
By analyzing the diff, we can recover the original flag that was intentionally hidden.
```bash
