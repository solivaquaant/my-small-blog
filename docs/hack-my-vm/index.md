# Overview
Welcome to the HackMyVM (HMV) section of my blog!

**[HackMyVM](https://hackmyvm.eu)** is a community-driven, hands-on cybersecurity platform focused on vulnerable virtual machines (VMs). It provides a space for users to build, share, and practice their penetration testing skills on community-created "boot-to-root" style machines.

On HackMyVM, the primary goal is "boot-to-root." 
You download a VM, identify vulnerabilities, and escalate privileges to gain full administrative access (the "root" user).

### Why HackMyVM?
HackMyVM offers a fantastic, free library of machines created by the community. It's an excellent environment for those who want to:

- Improve practical offensive security skills.
- Learn the full process of enumerating a target, finding vulnerabilities, and escalating privileges.
- Practice on a diverse range of VMs built by different authors, each with unique challenges.
- Prepare for roles in penetration testing or security analysis.

HMV has a strong community focus, allowing you to see how others approach problems and even submit your own VMs.

### What you'll find here
In this section I share my personal write-ups and solutions for HackMyVM machines. Each write-up explains not only **how** I solved the problem, but also **why** I chose the approach - the goal is to help you understand the investigative process: where to look, how to analyze findings, and how to craft an exploit.

Write-ups will be organized by the VM, detailing the path from initial enumeration to final root access.

Happy hacking!
