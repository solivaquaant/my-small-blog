## 🔎 Solution
The task in this challenge was to determine the city. 
The provided image was a Ukrainian vehicle license plate.

Looking into information about [Vehicle Registration Plates of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plates_of_Ukraine), each region or major city is assigned a specific prefix.

The plate shown in the image was:
```
AA 3330 BP
```

The prefix is `AA`, which corresponds to the city of **Kyiv**.
