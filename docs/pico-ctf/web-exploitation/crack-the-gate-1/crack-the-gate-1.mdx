# Crack the Gate 1

- **Description:** We're in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. 
We've uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. 
Unfortunately, we don't know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven't worked. But something feels off... it's almost like the developer left a secret way in. 
Can you figure it out?

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
While testing the web application I encountered a standard login form that requested an email and password. 
I first submitted the provided email with an arbitrary password and received an "Invalid credentials" response.

I then inspected the page source and found a commented line of text. 
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./cmt.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
Using [a text identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) I recognized the comment as **ROT13-encoded**. 
Decoding it produced the plaintext:
```
NOTE: Jack - temporary bypass: use header "X-Dev-Access: yes"
```
This suggested a developer backdoor that bypasses authentication when the `X-Dev-Access: yes` header is present.

To verify, I intercepted the `POST /login` request with **Burp Suite**, added the header `X-Dev-Access: yes`, and forwarded the modified request. 
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./burp.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
The server accepted the request and returned the challenge flag.
