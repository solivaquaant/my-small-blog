- **Description:** Can you get the flag?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
While inspecting the source code of the web page, I noticed a reference to an external JavaScript file:
```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

Switching over to the **Sources** tab in the browser's developer tools, I located and opened `script.js`. 
Within it, I found a part of the flag cleverly embedded in the script.
```js title="script.js"

function greetings()
{
  alert("This code is in a separate file!");
}
//  f7w_2of2_b8f4b022}
function sayHello()
{
  greetings();
}
```

Continuing my investigation, I opened another file listed there - `style.css`. 
Interestingly, it contained another part of the flag, subtly hidden among the styles.
```css title="style.css"
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

/*  picoCTF{1nclu51v17y_1of2_  */
```
Combining both segments from `script.js` and `style.css` revealed the complete flag.
