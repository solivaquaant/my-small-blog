## 🔎 Solution
The objective of this challenge was to identify the street name related to the provided image.

Searching the image on Google revealed that it is located in **Paris, France**. 
To speed up the process, I used **Gemini** to assist with the location analysis. 
The result suggested the following details:
- Possible shooting position: near the intersection of **Rue du Mont-Cenis** and **Rue Cortot**.
- View direction: looking toward the intersection with **Rue Saint-Vincent** at the bottom of the stairs.
- The area is located right behind the **Sacré-Cœur** basilica.

With this information, the search radius could be narrowed down.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./small.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

At the identified location, the same building from the image can be spotted:
```

```
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./res.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

After testing both potential street names - Rue du Mont-Cenis and Rue Saint-Vincent - the correct answer turned out to be **Rue Saint-Vincent**.
