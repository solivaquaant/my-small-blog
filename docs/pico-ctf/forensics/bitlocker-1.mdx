# Bitlocker-1

- **Description:** Jacky is not very knowledgable about the best security passwords and used a simple password to encrypt their BitLocker drive. See if you can break through the encryption!
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Upon analyzing the provided `bitlocker-1.dd` disk image, we identified the presence of the string **FVE-FS**, which signifies a BitLocker-encrypted volume (Full Volume Encryption File System). 
This confirms that the partition has been secured using BitLocker.
```bash
> file bitlocker-1.dd 
bitlocker-1.dd: DOS/MBR boot sector, code offset 0x58+2, OEM-ID "-FVE-FS-", sectors/cluster 8, reserved sectors 0, Media descriptor 0xf8, sectors/track 63, heads 255, hidden sectors 124499968, FAT (32 bit), sectors/FAT 8160, serial number 0, unlabeled; NTFS, sectors/track 63, physical drive 0x1fe0, $MFT start cluster 393217, serial number 02020454d414e204f, checksum 0x41462020
```

To proceed, we used the `bitlocker2john` tool to extract a hash from the encrypted volume. 
```bash
bitlocker2john -i bitlocker-1.dd > bitlocker_hash.txt 
```

From the tool's output, we isolated only the relevant portion of the hash:
```bash
$bitlocker$0$16$cb4809fe9628471a411f8380e0f668db$1048576$12$d04d9c58eed6da010a000000$60$68156e51e53f0a01c076a32ba2b2999afffce8530fbe5d84b4c19ac71f6c79375b87d40c2d871ed2b7b5559d71ba31b6779c6f41412fd6869442d66d
```
Next, we launched a brute-force attack using John the Ripper along with the well-known `rockyou.txt` wordlist. 
The correct password was successfully recovered as **jacqueline**.
```bash
> john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
Note: This format may emit false positives, so it will keep trying even after finding a possible candidate.

Session aborted
```

We then set up 2 directories to assist with the decryption and mounting process:
- `/media/bit`: to store the decrypted BitLocker data.
- `/media/win`: to serve as the mount point for accessing the file system.

Using the password retrieved earlier, we decrypted the volume with `dislocker`:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /media/bit
sudo chmod 777 /media/bit
sudo dislocker -V bitlocker-1.dd -ujacqueline -- /media/bit
```

After successful decryption, a virtual file named `dislocker-file` was created in `/media/bit`. This file represents the unlocked volume.
```bash
> sudo ls /media/bit                 
dislocker-file
```

Next, we mounted the decrypted volume:
```bash
> sudo mkdir -p /media/win                                  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
> sudo mount -o loop /media/bit/dislocker-file /media/win
The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).
Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.
Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
or fast restarting.)
Could not mount read-write, trying read-only
```

During mounting, the system detected an unclean file system state (likely due to hibernation or improper shutdown in Windows). 
As a result, the volume was mounted in **read-only** mode for safety.  
Finally, we navigated to the mounted directory and retrieved the flag.
```bash
> cat flag.txt 
picoCTF{us3_b3tt3r_p4ssw0rd5_pl5!_3242adb1} 
```
