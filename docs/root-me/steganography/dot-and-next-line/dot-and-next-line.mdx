## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Although this challenge is labeled as *very easy* and doesn't require any advanced technical skills to solve, it can still be quite tricky and misleading for players.  

The challenge statement is written in French, and the provided image is also in French. 
However, the language itself turns out to be largely irrelevant to solving the puzzle.  

Based on the challenge title, **Dot and next line**, the key idea is to locate all the dots (periods) in the image.
<div style={{ width: '80%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./dot1.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

For each dot, we look at the character directly above it on the previous line.
<div style={{ width: '80%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
By collecting those characters in order, we reconstruct the string `chatelet15h`, and that is the correct flag for the challenge.
