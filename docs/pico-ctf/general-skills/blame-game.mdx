## ðŸ”Ž Solution
While reviewing the commit history using `git log`, we notice a large number of entries with the same message: **important business work**. 
This repetition makes it difficult to identify meaningful changes.
```bash
> git log

    important business work

    important business work
```
Fortunately, the directory contains only a single file - **message.py**. To narrow the scope, we use `git log message.py`.
This command filters the log to only show commits that modified the specific file, making it easier to trace relevant activity.
Among the results, one commit stands out with the message: **optimize file size of prod code**. The author of that commit is the flag we're looking for.
```bash
> git log message.py
