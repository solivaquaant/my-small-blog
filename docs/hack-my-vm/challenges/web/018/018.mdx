## 🔎 Solution
The website content contains a hint that the flag is located in `aaAxghuyrtlksd.php`:
```
Maybe the flag is in aaAxghuyrtlksd.php
```

Accessing `http://momo.hackmyvm.eu/ZiP004JfyGh/aaAxghuyrtlksd.php` returns the following response:
```
Yes, I have the flag! :)
```

However, inspecting the page source does not reveal any hidden flag. 
This suggests the need to change the HTTP request method.

Sending this request to the Repeater in Burp Suite and changing the method to POST successfully retrieves the flag.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
