- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The goal of this challenge is to locate and read the contents of a file named `uber-secret.txt` after extracting a given archive or directory.
To find the file, we use the following command `find [path-to-directory] -name [file-name]`. This command recursively searches through the directory tree for the target file by name.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ find files -name "uber-secret.txt" 
files/adequate_books/more_books/.secret/deeper_secrets/deepest_secrets/uber-secret.txt
```

Once the correct path to `uber-secret.txt` is identified, simply display its contents and the flag will be revealed within the file.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ cat files/adequate_books/more_books/.secret/deeper_secrets/deepest_secrets/uber-secret.txt
picoCTF{f1nd_15_f457_ab443fd1}
```
