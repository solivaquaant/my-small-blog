After running the provided command in the terminal, the output unfolds like a narrative - almost like reading the beginning of a story.
```

FANTASY CTF SIMULATION

The simulation begins in the private room of Eibhilin, a bright, young student.
The room is dimly lit, with the glow of her multiple monitors casting an
electric blue hue on the walls. Around the room are posters of vintage movies
from the MCU - ancient guardians from another age staring down like digital
sentinels.

I pressed Enter repeatedly until a set of choices appeared on the screen.
```
Options:
A) *Register multiple accounts*
B) *Share an account with a friend*
C) *Register a single, private account*
[a/b/c] > 
```

Choosing option a, I continued navigating forward with more presses of the Enter key.
```
Nyx chimes in, "Eibhilin, don't do that! That's been grounds for
disqualification for the past 1,000 years!"

"Oh, thanks Nyx, that was close!"

(Press Enter to continue...)

"Ok," Nyx says, "Registering you for the competition... There's an introductory
audio message, piping to your speakers."

(Press Enter to continue...)
```

Soon, another decision point came up, offering a new set of options. I made a choice and went with the first one.
```
Options:
A) *Play the game*
B) *Search the Ether for the flag*
[a/b] > a
```

To my surprise, after what felt like playing an interactive story game, the character managed to discover the flag.
```
"Thanks, Nyx! Here's the flag I found: picoCTF{m1113n1um_3d1710n_dc6af91c}"
```
And just like that, we had the flag we were looking for.
