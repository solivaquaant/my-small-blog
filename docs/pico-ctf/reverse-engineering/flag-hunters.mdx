# Flag Hunters

- **Description:** Lyrics jump from verses to the refrain kind of like a subroutine call. 
There's a hidden refrain this program doesn't print by default. 
Can you get it to print it? There might be something in it for you.
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## 🔎 Solution
By analyzing the source code, we can see that the flag is embedded in the `secret_intro` variable, which is then prepended to the beginning of the full lyrics stored in `song_flag_hunters`.
```python
secret_intro = \
'''...'''\
+ flag + '\n'

song_flag_hunters = secret_intro +\
'''...'''
```
However, in line 132, the program begins execution from the label `[VERSE1]`, skipping over the introductory lines - meaning the flag isn't shown by default.
```python
reader(song_flag_hunters, '[VERSE1]')
```

The song is structured into verses (`[VERSE]`) and repeated choruses (`[REFRAIN]`), and the code also interprets a few special commands embedded in the lyrics:
- **REFRAIN:** jump to the chorus section
- **RETURN:** marks the end of the chorus, and jumps back to the line after the original call
- **CROWD:** prompts the user to input a custom line
- **END:** stops the song

The key lies in the `CROWD` instruction, which allows the user to input arbitrary text without any validation:
```python
elif re.match(r"CROWD.*", line):
    crowd = input('Crowd: ')
    song_lines[lip] = 'Crowd: ' + crowd
    lip += 1
```
In addition, there's the `RETURN [line_number]` command, which allows a jump to a specific line number:
```python
elif re.match(r"RETURN [0-9]+", line):
    lip = int(line.split()[1])
```

At first glance, it seems we could try injecting something like **RETURN 0** through the CROWD input to jump to the very start of the song - where the flag is embedded. 
However, this doesn't work as expected. The program treats the entire user input as a single literal string, not an actual command.

But upon inspecting this part of this code `for line in song_lines[lip].split(';')`,
we realize something clever: each line can be split into multiple sub - commands using the semicolon **;** delimiter.

So, if we craft our input as **;RETURN 0**, the RETURN 0 becomes a standalone command during parsing.
This allows us to inject a valid jump command through the CROWD prompt, redirecting execution to the very top of the lyrics where the flag resides - effectively bypassing the normal flow and revealing the hidden flag.

Command line wizards, we're starting it right,
Spawning shells in the terminal, hacking all night.
Scripts and searches, grep through the void,
Every keystroke, we're a cypher's envoy.
Brute force the lock or craft that regex,
Flag on the horizon, what challenge is next?

We're flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We're chasing that victory, and we'll never quit.

Crowd: ;RETURN 0

Echoes in memory, packets in trace,
Digging through the remnants to uncover with haste.
Hex and headers, carving out clues,
Resurrect the hidden, it's forensics we choose.
Disk dumps and packet dumps, follow the trail,
Buried deep in the noise, but we will prevail.

We're flag hunters in the ether, lighting up the grid,
No puzzle too dark, no challenge too hid.
With every exploit we trigger, every byte we decrypt,
We're chasing that victory, and we'll never quit.
Crowd: 
Pico warriors rising, puzzles laid bare,
Solving each challenge with precision and flair.
With unity and skill, flags we deliver,
