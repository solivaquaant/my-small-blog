# Tab, Tab, Attack

- **Description:** Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames:
- **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🔎 Solution
In Linux, using the **Tab key** while typing in the terminal enables auto-completion of file and directory names. 
This feature not only speeds up navigation but also helps reveal hidden or deeply nested paths by pressing Tab repeatedly.  
To solve this challenge, starting from the directory where the recently extracted folder is located, 
we use Tab repeatedly to auto-complete through each nested level until reaching the final file.
And the flag is revealed.
```bash
> ./Addadshashanammu/Addadshashanammu/Almurbalarammi/Ashalmimilkala/Assurnabitashpi/Maelkashishi/Onnissiralis/Ularradallaku/fang-of-haynekhtnamet 
*ZAP!* picoCTF{l3v3l_up!_t4k3_4_r35t!_a00cae70}
