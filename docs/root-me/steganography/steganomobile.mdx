## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The content of the provided .txt file consists of a sequence of numbers, formatted as shown below.
```
222-33-555-555-7-44-666-66-33
```
To identify the encoding format, I used a [text identifier tool](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), 
which recognized the sequence as **Multi-tap Phone (SMS)** input - the type used on old mobile keypads where each number corresponds to multiple letters.  

Using a [Multi-tap decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/multitap-abc-cipher), I entered the numeric sequence, and the output revealed the word `cellphone`.
This turned out to be the correct solution for the challenge.
