# Mission 0x20

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as **eliza**, the next hint suggested that the upcoming access wouldn't require a password but rather a stored key.
```

## EN ##
The user iris has left me her key.
```

Checking the home directory revealed a private OpenSSH key:
```
eliza@venus:~$ cat .iris_key 
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAABlwAAAAdzc2gtcn
NhAAAAAwEAAQAAAYEAstTtUVotXEIF5+w37pKse/YGLEMMMnMB2DQQ1EF/KP7ey72FhO9S
Jk4wPtBZ6+pPKefUA2uSJHGhHia++uBOcuWt3SAdR5gUqxpdFTgYqZczWEgCDoY/L0rUQG
```

Since this is a private key, SSH can use it for authentication - but only if the file permissions are secure. 
SSH refuses to use keys that are readable by others, so the permission needs to be restricted:
```
chmod 600 .iris_key 
```

With the permissions fixed, the login attempt worked:
```
ssh -i .iris_key iris@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000 
```

Inside **iris's** account, the flag was waiting as usual:
```
iris@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===ClrdWOqlZ1vL61zSk9Va===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
