# Mission 0x12

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting to the target via SSH as user `lucy`, the next objective is to extract the password hidden in a specific pattern inside the system. 
According to the mission file, the string for the next user (`elena`) is located between the characters `fu` and `ck`.
```
lucy@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x12 #
################

## EN ##
The password of the user elena is between the characters fu and ck 
```

To search for this pattern efficiently, I used `grep` with a regex expression matching anything between `fu` and `ck`:
```
lucy@venus:~$ cat file.yo | grep "fu.*ck"
fu4xZ5lIKYmfPLg9tck
```

The substring between `fu` and `ck` reveals the password:
```
4xZ5lIKYmfPLg9t
```

With the extracted password, I logged into the next account:
```
ssh elena@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once inside, I checked the home directory and found the flag:
```
elena@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===st1pTdqEQ0bvrJfWGwLA===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===st1pTdqEQ0bvrJfWGwLA===D~~`
