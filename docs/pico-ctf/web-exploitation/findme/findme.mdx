## ðŸ”Ž Solution
When accessing the website, I was greeted with a login form. 
Using the credentials `test:test`, I was able to log in successfully.

After logging in, the site redirected me to a page containing a search input. 
However, during the redirection process, I noticed a brief appearance of an unusual URL.

Inspecting the traffic with **Burp Suite**, I observed that 2 separate `/next-page` requests were made before the final redirection to `/home`.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Each of these requests included a suspicious-looking Base64-encoded `id` parameter. 
After decoding both strings and concatenating them, I was able to recover the complete flag.
