# Hash - SHA-2

- **Description:** This hash was stolen during a session interception on a critical application, errors may have occurred during transmission. 
No crack attempt has resulted so far; hash format seems unknown. 
Find the corresponding plaintext.
The answer is the SHA-1 of this password.
- **Difficulty:** Very easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge provides a suspicious-looking string, and according to the statement, it may have been *corrupted* during transmission.
```
96719db60d8e3f498c98d94155e1296aac105ck4923290c89eeeb3ba26d3eef92
```

Upon inspection, the string contains the character **"k"**, which is weird, as "k" is not a valid hexadecimal character (hexadecimal only includes **0-9** and **a-f**). 
This suggests the string is not a valid hexadecimal hash in its current form.

By simply removing the invalid "k" character, the string becomes:
```
96719db60d8e3f498c98d94155e1296aac105c4923290c89eeeb3ba26d3eef92
```
This is a valid **SHA-256** hash. 
Using [this tool](https://md5decrypt.net/), I was able to decrypt it and retrieve the original plaintext as `4dM1n`.

Hashing this string using **SHA-1** produces the final result:
```
a7c9d5a37201c08c5b7b156173bea5ec2063edf9
```
This is the flag.
