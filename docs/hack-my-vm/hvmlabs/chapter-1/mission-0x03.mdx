# Mission 0x03

## 🔎 Solution
After SSH'ing in as `angela`, the next task was to retrieve `emma`'s password, which the mission states is located on line 4069 of a provided file:
```
angela@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x03 #
################

## EN ##
The password of the user emma is in line 4069 of the file findme.txt
```

There are multiple ways to extract a specific line from a file. I used a simple `head` + `tail` pipeline to get line 4069:
```
angela@venus:~$ head -n 4069 findme.txt | tail -n 1
fIvltaGaq0OUH8O
```

Explanation:
* `head -n 4069 findme.txt` prints the first 4,069 lines of the file.
* The pipe `|` passes that output as input to the next command.
* `tail -n 1` takes the last line from the piped input, which is line 4,069 of the original file.

With the recovered password I SSH'd into `emma`:
```
ssh emma@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside `emma`'s account I read the flag file:
```
emma@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===0daqdDlmd9XogkiHu4yq===D~~
```
