## 🔎 Solution
The website interface appears empty. Inspecting the source code reveals the following script:
```
<script type="text/javascript">
	var pass = unescape("unescape%28%22String.fromCharCode%2528104%252C68%252C117%252C102%252C106%252C100%252C107%252C105%252C49%252C53%252C54%2529%22%29");
</script>
```

We will now decode this string step by step.

The first decode operation yields:
```
unescape("String.fromCharCode%28104%2C68%2C117%2C102%2C106%2C100%2C107%2C105%2C49%2C53%2C54%29")
```

Continuing the decoding process produces:
```
String.fromCharCode(104,68,117,102,106,100,107,105,49,53,54)
```

Converting these decimal values to ASCII gives us the string: `hDufjdki156`
