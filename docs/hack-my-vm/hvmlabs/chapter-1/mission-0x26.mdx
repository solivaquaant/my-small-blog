# Mission 0x26

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in via SSH as *alexa*, the next objective is to retrieve the password for user *ariel*. 
The hint suggests that the password is available online over **HTTP**.
```
alexa@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x26 #
################

## EN ##
The password of the user ariel is online! (HTTP)
```

To locate the service, the network configuration is checked to identify the IP address of the current machine:
```
alexa@venus:~$ ip a
9: eth0@if10: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default 
    link/ether 02:42:ac:42:00:0a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
    inet 172.66.0.10/24 brd 172.66.0.255 scope global eth0
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
```

With the host identified as `172.66.0.10`, the next step is to request the HTTP service on port 80. 
The response contains the password:
```
alexa@venus:~$ curl http://172.66.0.10:80/
33EtHoz9a0w2Yqo
```

Using this credential, a new SSH login is performed:
```
ssh ariel@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once logged in, reading the final file reveals the flag:
```
ariel@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===lqTeJ1msxhNjNJCptxmZ===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===lqTeJ1msxhNjNJCptxmZ===D~~`
