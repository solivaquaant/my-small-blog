# WPA-ing Out

- **Description:** I thought that my password was super-secret, but it turns out that passwords passed over the AIR can be CRACKED, especially if I used the same wireless network password as one in the rockyou.txt credential dump.
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After opening the pcap file in Wireshark, it's clear that the captured data comes from an **IEEE 802.11** wireless network with the SSID **Gone_Surfing**. The capture contains various packets, including EAPOL packets, which are used in the WPA/WPA2 authentication process.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./frame1.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Using `aircrack-ng`, I analyzed the capture to determine whether the traffic was encrypted. 
The result showed that the network with SSID "Gone_Surfing" used WPA encryption and contained one handshake.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ aircrack-ng wpa-ing_out.pcap

To attempt password cracking, I ran the command:
```bash
aircrack-ng wpa-ing_out.pcap -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
Using the RockYou wordlist, the correct password was successfully recovered: **mickeymouse**.
The flag for this challenge is the password itself: **mickeymouse**.
