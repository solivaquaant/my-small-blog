# Static ain't always noise

- **Description:** Can you look at the data in this binary: static? This BASH script might help!
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge provides 2 files: a program file and a Bash script. 
The Bash script is designed to disassemble a binary executable and extract readable strings from it.  
After granting execute permissions to the script and running it with the binary file as an argument, it generates 2 output files: `static.ltdis.strings.txt` and `static.ltdis.x86_64.txt`.
```bash                                                                                                                
> chmod +x ./ltdis.sh 
                                                                                                             
> ./ltdis.sh static 
Attempting disassembly of static ...
Disassembly successful! Available at: static.ltdis.x86_64.txt
Ripping strings from binary with file offsets...
Any strings found in static have been written to static.ltdis.strings.txt with file offset
```
By inspecting the contents of `static.ltdis.strings.txt`, you can discover the flag.
```bash
> cat static.ltdis.strings.txt 
    238 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
    361 libc.so.6
    36b puts
    370 __cxa_finalize
    37f __libc_start_main
    391 GLIBC_2.2.5
    39d _ITM_deregisterTMCloneTable
    3b9 __gmon_start__
    3c8 _ITM_registerTMCloneTable
    660 AWAVI
    667 AUATL
    6ba []A\A]A^A_
    6e8 Oh hai! Wait what? A flag? Yes, it's around here somewhere!
    7c7 ;*3$"
   1020 picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_ae0b3ef2}
```

Another way to solve this challenge is by using the `strings` command in combination with `grep` to search for the keyword **picoCTF** directly within the `static` file. 
This approach also reveals the flag.
```bash
> strings static | grep "picoCTF"          
picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_ae0b3ef2}
```
