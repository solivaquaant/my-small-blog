## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Upon accessing the challenge's main webpage, nothing appeared on the screen. 
However, inspecting the page's source code revealed a comment pointing to `<!-- /web-serveur/ch6/phpbb -->`.

Navigating to that directory displayed the header of the Root Me website, though no significant content was present.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./bb.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

The challenge references **phpBB**, an open-source forum software written in PHP. 
It is one of the most widely used free forum platforms globally.

A quick search for common *phpBB directory structures* led to the discovery that the `/install` directory often contains installation-related files. 
This information was confirmed by documentation on the [official phpBB website](https://www.phpbb.com/community/docs/INSTALL.html).

Following that lead, we navigated to `/web-serveur/ch6/phpbb/install/`, where we found an `index.php` file.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./install.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Examining its contents ultimately revealed the flag.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
