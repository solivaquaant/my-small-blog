# Mission 0x09

## 🔎 Solution
After SSH'ing in as `victoria`, the mission hinted that the next password was stored inside a ZIP file:
```
victoria@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x09 #
################

## EN ##
The user isla has left her password in a zip file.
```

To extract the archive, I used `unzip` and chose `/tmp` as the extraction directory:
```
victoria@venus:~$ unzip passw0rd.zip -d /tmp
Archive:  passw0rd.zip
replace /tmp/pwned/victoria/passw0rd.txt? [y]es, [n]o, [A]ll, [N]one, [r]ename: y
 extracting: /tmp/pwned/victoria/passw0rd.txt  
```

Opening the extracted file revealed the password:
```
victoria@venus:~$ cat /tmp/pwned/victoria/passw0rd.txt 
D3XTob0FUImsoBb
```

With that credential, I logged in as `isla`:
```
ssh isla@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Then grabbed the next flag:
```
isla@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===ZyZqc1suvGe4QlkZHFlq===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
