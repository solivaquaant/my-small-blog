# The Numbers

- **Description:** The numbers... what do they mean?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
In this challenge, we are provided with an image containing a sequence of numbers.
```
16 9 3 15 3 20 6 {20 8 5 14 21 13 2 5 18 19 13 1 19 15 14}
```
At first, I attempted to interpret these numbers as ASCII codes by converting them using different bases (decimal, hexadecimal, binary,...), but none of the conversions produced meaningful output. 
So, I started to consider alternative possibilities. 

Notably, all the numbers in the image are relatively small-each less than 20. 
This led me to suspect that they might represent positions of letters in the English alphabet, where A = 1, B = 2, ..., Z = 26.  

To speed things up, I used [this tool](https://numletter.com/) that maps numerical positions to letters. 
Upon entering the sequence, the output revealed the correct flag.
