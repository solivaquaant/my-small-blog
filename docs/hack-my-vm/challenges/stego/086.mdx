## 🔎 Solution
With the provided image file, the first step was checking its metadata. 
Using `exiftool`, I noticed that the `Comment` field contained a suspicious Base64-encoded string:
```
> exiftool EZPZ.png 
ExifTool Version Number         : 13.25
File Name                       : EZPZ.png
Comment                         : MDEwMDAwMDEgMDEwMDAwMTAgMDEwMDAxMTEgMDEwMTExMTEgMDEwMDExMTAgMDEwMTExMTEgMDEwMTAwMTEgMDEwMTEwMDEgMDEwMDExMTAgMDEwMTAxMDAgMDExMTEwMTEgMDEwMTEwMDEgMDEwMDAxMTAgMDEwMDExMTEgMDExMTExMDE=
```

After decoding the Base64 string, it revealed a binary sequence:
```
01000001 01000010 01000111 01011111 01001110 01011111 01010011 01011001 01001110 01010100 01111011 01011001 01000110 01001111 0111110
```

Decoding the binary string gave:
```
ABG_N_SYNT{YFO}
```

Using the cipher detection tool [Text Identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), it was identified as a **ROT13** cipher. 
Running it through a [ROT13 decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher) resulted in:
```
NOT_A_FLAG{LSB}
```

As expected from the string, this wasn't the actual flag - just a hint. 
The message clearly points toward **LSB steganography** (Least Significant Bit), a technique used to hide data within the least significant bits of image pixel values.

One commonly used tool for detecting and extracting LSB-based hidden content is `zsteg`, so I ran it against the image. 
This time, the actual flag appeared in the output:
```
