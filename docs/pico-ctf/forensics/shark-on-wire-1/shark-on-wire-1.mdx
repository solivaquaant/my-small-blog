## ðŸ”Ž Solution
I started by opening the pcap file in Wireshark.
My initial approach was to examine the TCP streams, but they didn't reveal any useful information.

Shifting focus to the UDP streams, I began to notice meaningful data.
In the fifth UDP stream, the string **picopicopico** appeared.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./pico.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Finally, by following the sixth UDP stream, I was able to extract the challenge flag.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
