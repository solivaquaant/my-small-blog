# FindAndOpen

- **Description:** Someone might have hidden the password in the trace file.
Find the key to unlock this file. This tracefile might be good to analyze.
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge provides two files: a `.pcap` capture and a `.zip` archive.
I began by analyzing the `.pcap` file using Wireshark.

Upon inspection, the capture contains two main types of packets:
1. mDNS protocol packets
2. Packets labeled as **Ethernet II** in the *Info* column.  
I focused on the second type first.

Packets 1-9 have a custom Protocol ID of `0x6865`, and their Data fields contain numeric sequences. 
When concatenated and decoded, they reveal the string: *"Flying on Ethernet secret: Is this the flag"*
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./1.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Packets 23-47 contain additional data. 
When combining both the Protocol and Data fields and decoding the result, I extracted: *"iBwaWNvQ1RGe1Could the flag have been splitted?"*

Packet 48 contains a Base64-encoded Data string: *"VGhpcyBpcyB0aGUgc2VjcmV0OiBwaWNvQ1RGe1IzNERJTkdfTE9LZF8="*.
Decoding this gives:*"This is the secret: `picoCTF{R34DING_LOKd_"`*

Packets 49-57 appear to contain more obfuscated content, such as: *"PBwaWUvQ1RGesabababkjaASKBKSBACVVAVSDDSSSSDSKJBJS"*

Packets 58-65 provide a clearer hint: *"PBwaWUvQ1RGe1Maybe try checking the other file"*

At this point, the only meaningful output was a partial flag:
```
picoCTF{R34DING_LOKd_
```

Following the hint from the final packets, I turned my attention to the `.zip` file. 
Using the partial flag as the password, I successfully extracted its contents.
Read the content of the extracted file and was able to complete the flag.
