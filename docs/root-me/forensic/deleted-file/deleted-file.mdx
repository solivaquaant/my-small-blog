# Deleted file

- **Description:** Your cousin found a USB drive in the library this morning. 
He's not very good with computers, so he's hoping you can find the owner of this stick!
The flag is the owner's identity in the form `firstname_lastname`
- **Difficulty:** Very Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The provided file is a USB image. 
To analyze it, we can use **[FTK Imager](https://www.exterro.com/ftk-product-downloads/ftk-imager-4-7-3-81)**. 
Start by selecting **Image File** under the **Select Source** option to load the image.  
Once loaded, navigate to the `/root` directory, where an image file is located. 
Right-click on the image and choose **Export Files** to extract it.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./ftk.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

After exporting, view the file's Properties. From the metadata, we can identify the owner of the image as **Javier Turcot**.
<div style={{ width: '50%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./author.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
