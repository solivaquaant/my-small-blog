# Mission 0x34

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting as *noa*, the next step points to a file that appears intentionally messy.
```
noa@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x34 #
################

## EN ##
The password of maia is surrounded by trash 
```

Opening the file normally isn't very readable, so using `strings` is a better approach to filter out meaningful ASCII sequences.
```js
noa@venus:~$ strings trash

Among the junk data, there's a recognizable pattern:
```
\nh1hnDPHpydEjoEN
```

All previous passwords in this challenge series have been 15 characters long, so removing the initial `\n` gives:
```
h1hnDPHpydEjoEN
```

With that password, the next SSH login works:
```
ssh maia@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Retrieving the flag confirms the progression:
```
maia@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===nu8IDScKFAXVcnFutKtG===D~~
```
