## 🔎 Solution
For this challenge, the task was to identify the country depicted in the image.

Since the image lacked distinctive features, searching it directly on Google didn't yield any results. 
Observing the top-right corner, I noticed a sign with the text **"Cermodern."**
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./banner.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

Searching for this location on Maps revealed that it is in Turkey.

## 🚩Flag
