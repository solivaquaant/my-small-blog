# Mission 0x38

## 🔎 Solution
Once logged in as **julie**, the next objective hinted at comparing differences:
```
julie@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x38 #
################

## EN ##
The user irene believes that the beauty is in the difference.
```

In the home directory, 2 files were provided: `1.txt` and `2.txt`. 
Since the hint suggested a difference, the logical approach was to compare them using `diff`.
```
julie@venus:~$ diff 1.txt 2.txt 
174c174
< 8VeRLEFkBpe2DSD
---
> aNHRdohjOiNizlU
```

The output showed that only a single line differed. 
That meant one of these strings had to be the password. 
Testing them revealed the correct one:
```
8VeRLEFkBpe2DSD
```

With that, I could access the next account:
```
ssh irene@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside the home directory, the flag was stored in the usual location:
```
irene@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===c9hgLkLGzsNw7mB3VEr4===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
