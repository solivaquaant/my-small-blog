# Mission 0x19

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as **frida**, the next task focused on analyzing a file containing repeated lines.
```

# MISSION 0x19 #
################

## EN ##
The password of eliza is the only string that is repeated (unsorted) in repeated.txt.
```

The hint suggested that among all entries in the file, only one string appears more than once. 
The `uniq` command includes an option that makes this easy: `-d`, which outputs only duplicated lines.

Running it against the provided file:
```
frida@venus:~$ uniq -d repeated.txt 
Fg6b6aoksceQqB9
```

That repeated value turned out to be the next password. Using it allowed access to the user **eliza**:
```
ssh eliza@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once inside, checking the usual file revealed the next flag:
```
eliza@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===zwWIPyDf2ozwVhCTxm1I===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===zwWIPyDf2ozwVhCTxm1I===D~~`
