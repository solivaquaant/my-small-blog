# Big Zip

- **Description:** Unzip this archive and find the flag.
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After extracting the zip archive, we discover a massive collection of files and directories - a total of 3076 items.
```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~/Desktop]
â””â”€$ ls -la big-zip-files    
total 3076
drwxrwxr-x 121 kali kali 36864 May  3  2020 .
drwxr-xr-x   7 kali kali  4096 May 24 10:15 ..
-rw-rw-r--   1 kali kali    88 May  3  2020 acurqdgqyoi.txt
-rw-rw-r--   1 kali kali    87 May  3  2020 aecwqhyouxkugpjtn.txt
-rw-rw-r--   1 kali kali    88 May  3  2020 agkahcbvobe.txt
```

To locate the flag string that follows the **picoCTF** format, we use the grep command with the `-r` option.
The `-r` flag (short for `--recursive`) tells grep to search through all files and directories recursively, making it ideal for scanning through large nested structures like this one.
```bash
grep -r "picoCTF"
```
The result points us to the file containing the flag:
```bash  
big-zip-files/folder_pmbymkjcya/folder_cawigcwvgv/folder_ltdayfmktr/folder_fnpfclfyee/whzxrpivpqld.txt:information on the record will last a billion years. Genes and brains and books encode picoCTF{gr3p_15_m4g1c_ef8790dc}
```
