## 🔎 Solution
The goal of this challenge was to identify the name of the shop with the blackboard sign in front, shown in the image.

Looking closely at the picture, there's a distinctive green building at the end of the street. 
Searching the image online, I found [an article](https://www.curiousgoosetravel.com/post/15-must-see-places-in-paris) that includes the same building. 
The location mentioned is a street in **Paris' Latin Quarter**.

Checking similar images led me to [a Flickr photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pavellarkin/14516128107/) that shows the adjacent shop next to that same green building. 
The name of the neighboring shop is **ODETTE**.

Searching this shop on Maps confirmed that it is indeed located in the Latin Quarter of Paris. 
Using ODETTE as a reference point and comparing the image layout, I was able to identify the target shop. 
Its name is **The Tea Caddy**.
