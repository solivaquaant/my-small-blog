# Mission 0x42

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as **sarah**, the next objective referenced a hidden password somewhere in the current directory:
```
sarah@venus:~$ cat mission.txt  
################
# MISSION 0x42 #
################

## EN ##
The password of mercy is hidden in this directory.
```

Listing the directory contents showed something unusual-among the typical files, there was a file literally named `...`, easy to miss if not paying attention:
```js
sarah@venus:~$ ls -la
total 36
drwxr-x--- 2 root  sarah 4096 Apr  5  2024 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root  root  4096 Apr  5  2024 ..
//highlight-next-line
-rw-r----- 1 root  sarah   16 Apr  5  2024 ...
-rw-r--r-- 1 sarah sarah  220 Apr 23  2023 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r-- 1 sarah sarah 3526 Apr 23  2023 .bashrc
-rw-r--r-- 1 sarah sarah  807 Apr 23  2023 .profile
-rw-r----- 1 root  sarah   31 Apr  5  2024 flagz.txt
-rw-r----- 1 root  sarah  175 Apr  5  2024 mission.txt
```

Opening this odd-looking file revealed the password:
```
sarah@venus:~$ cat ...
ym5yyXZ163uIS8L
```

Using it allowed SSH access to the next account:
```
ssh mercy@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once inside, the flag was stored as usual:
```
mercy@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===pBpnZCBSELaY0xQJ8YAY===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===pBpnZCBSELaY0xQJ8YAY===D~~`
