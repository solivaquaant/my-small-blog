## 🔎 Solution
The challenge provides a sequence of commands resembling x86 assembly code. 
The values pushed onto the stack are hexadecimal numbers representing strings, but they are pushed in reverse byte order (little-endian).

Here, we will decode each hex value into its corresponding character pairs. 
For example, the value `7d616579` is decoded as follows:
- `7d` = `}`
- `61` = `a`
- `65` = `e`
- `79` = `y`

When arranged in little-endian order, this becomes `yea}`.

Performing the same process for the remaining four hex strings yields the results in order: `thit`, `swor`, `amsi`, `hmv{`.

Due to the stack's LIFO (Last In, First Out) nature, the actual assembled string in the correct order is the flag.
