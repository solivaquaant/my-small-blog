# 007

- **Description:** `=0Xd0ʞƐMOqWMςЯzɘWƖƎƧ`

## 🔎 Solution
The challenge provides a rather unusual string:
```
=0Xd0ʞƐMOqWMςЯzɘWƖƎƧ
```

In this string, some characters like `ʞ` and `Ƨ` are flipped versions of `k` and `S`.

Using [a reverse text generator](https://www.textfixer.com/tools/reverse-text-generator.php) to reverse the string yields:
```
SEƖWezRςMWpOMƐk0bX0=
```

This appears to be a Base64 string, but it still contains special characters that need to be corrected to their standard forms. 
- Ɩ → l
- ς → 2
- Ɛ → 3

After correction, the string becomes:
```
SE1WezR2MWpOM3k0bX0=
```

Decoding it reveals the flag:
```
> echo "SE1WezR2MWpOM3k0bX0=" | base64 -d            
HMV{4v1jN3y4m}
```

## 🚩Flag
> `HMV{4v1jN3y4m}`
