# First Grep

- **Description:** Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge introduces the basics of the `grep` command - a powerful tool used to search for specific strings or patterns within files on Unix-based systems.  
You're given a text file, and your task is to search through it for a line containing the keyword **picoCTF**. If done correctly, the output will reveal the flag.
```bash
> cat file | grep "picoCTF"
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}
```

## ðŸš©Flag
> `picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_5af9d829}`
