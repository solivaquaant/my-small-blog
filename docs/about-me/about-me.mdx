# About me

> Hi, I'm **Thái Ngọc Diễm Trinh** - but you can just call me _Thái Trinh_.

I'm currently a final-year student majoring in Information Security at the University of Information Technology - VNU, and I'm expected to graduate in early 2026.
Alongside my studies, I'm working as a SOC Analyst at an IT solutions company.

My interests and skills focus on Blue Team practices, including threat hunting, log analysis, and digital forensics.
Through both academic training and real-world projects, I've built a strong foundation in detecting malicious activities, investigating incidents, and improving overall security posture.

## My journey into cybersecurity

Interestingly, cybersecurity wasn't my childhood dream.
As a kid, I once wanted to become a primary school teacher.
Later, during secondary school, I was drawn to International Relations.
For the longest time, I believed I would pursue one of these paths in university.

Everything changed in my final year of high school.
When it came time to choose my major, for several reasons I ended up applying to Information Security - a field I hadn't really planned for.

At first, it felt like an unexpected turn.
But once I stepped into this path, I decided to embrace it wholeheartedly.
And today, I can say that I genuinely enjoy the challenges and opportunities it brings.

I am particularly fascinated by the defensive side of cybersecurity.
I spend much of my time exploring CTF challenges, not only as a way to sharpen my problem-solving skills but also to simulate real-world attack scenarios.
From there, my passion naturally extends into incident response and threat hunting, where I enjoy piecing together scattered evidence to uncover malicious activity.
I am also deeply interested in malware analysis, as it allows me to understand adversary techniques at a deeper level and strengthen defensive strategies accordingly.

## What I work with

I love exploring new tools and technologies.
Here is a summary of the technical stack and tools I frequently use in my studies and projects:

- Security tools:
  - Network & Web: Nmap, Burp Suite, Wireshark.
  - Forensics & Blue team: Sysmon, Splunk, Autopsy, Volatility.
  - Reverse engineering & malware: GDB, Ghidra, Process Monitor, HxD, Dumpbin.
- Programming & Scripting:
  - Primary: Python, C/C++, Bash, PowerShell.
  - Others: C# (WinForms), SQL (SQLite), JavaScript.
- Development & DevOps: Git, Docker, Docusaurus, React.
- Operating systems: Linux (Kali, Ubuntu), Windows.

## Key projects

## About this blog

This blog is where I share:

- **CTF write-ups**: Detailed walkthroughs from platforms like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, picoCTF, Root Me, HackMyVM,... I document these not just for myself but also for others to learn from.
- **Lab experiments**: Hands-on case studies and lab setups.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Insights and techniques around blue teaming, threat hunting, and digital forensics,...

My writing style is hands-on, detailed, and approachable.
I aim to make technical concepts easier to understand and to provide clear demonstrations wherever possible.

_(English is not my first language, so I sometimes use AI tools to help refine my writing while keeping the technical content my own.)_

## Beyond cybersecurity

Outside of InfoSec, I enjoy making handmade crafts and crochet.
I even run a separate site dedicated to sharing crochet projects and little stories around that hobby.
And when I'm not busy with security or crafting, you'll probably find me cheering for my favorite esports team -
I'm a proud, long-time fan of **FINHAY Cerberus Esports**.
