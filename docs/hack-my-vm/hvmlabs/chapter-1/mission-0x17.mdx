# Mission 0x17

## 🔎 Solution
After logging in as **eva**, the next hint pointed toward a file that hadn't been modified in decades - specifically May 1, 1968.

The password of the clara user is found in a file modified on May 1, 1968.
```

To locate files based on modification date, the `find` command provides a useful option: `-mtime`.

Quick breakdown of its behavior:
* `-mtime N` → files modified roughly N days ago (between N and N+1).
* `-mtime +N` → modified more than N days ago.
* `-mtime -N` → modified within the last N days.

Since 1968 is extremely far back - roughly **20000 days** - files modified that long ago should fall under `-mtime +20000`.
Running the search:
```
eva@venus:~$ find / -mtime +20000 2>/dev/null
/usr/lib/cmdo
```

Only one result appeared. 
Checking it confirmed it contained what looked like a password:
```
eva@venus:~$ cat /usr/lib/cmdo 
39YziWp5gSvgQN9
```

Using that as a credential allowed an SSH login as **clara**:
```
ssh clara@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once inside, the flag was waiting:
```
clara@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===EJWmHDEQeEN1vIR7NYiH===D~~
```
