## 🔎 Solution
After downloading the file, the first thing I did was take a look inside. 
Nothing fancy-just a quick read to see if anything stood out. 
And yep… turns out the challenge didn't require any extra steps at all. 
The flag was sitting right there:
```
> cat flag.txt                
picoCTF{c0ngr4ts_0n_y0ur_s4n1ty} 
```
