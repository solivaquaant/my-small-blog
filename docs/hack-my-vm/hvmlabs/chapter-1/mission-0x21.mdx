# Mission 0x21

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting via SSH as *iris*, the next objective is retrieving *eloise*'s password.
```
iris@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x21 #
################

## EN ##
User eloise has saved her password in a particular way. 
```

Inside the same directory, there's a file named `irispass.txt` which contains the current logged-in user's password.
```
iris@venus:~$ cat irispass.txt 
kYjyoLcnBZ9EJdz
```

The file named `eloise` looks more interesting. 
The content starts with the sequence `/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAYABgAAD`, which is recognizable as a Base64-encoded JPEG header.
```
iris@venus:~$ cat eloise 
/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQEAYABgAAD/4RD...
```

To recover the hidden data, the Base64 string is decoded and saved as an image file:
```
cat eloise | base64 -d > /tmp/output.jpg
```

The generated file is then transferred to the local machine for analysis:
```
scp -P 5000 iris@venus.hackmyvm.eu:/tmp/output.jpg .
```

Opening the image reveals the password for *eloise*: `yOUJlV0SHOnbSPm`.

Using the recovered credentials, a new SSH session is established:
```
ssh eloise@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Finally, reading the last file reveals the flag:
```
eloise@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===57CzBLKaEq2N8YBFRu31===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===57CzBLKaEq2N8YBFRu31===D~~`
