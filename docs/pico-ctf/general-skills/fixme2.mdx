# fixme2.py

- **Description:** Fix the syntax error in this Python script to print the flag.
- **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🔎 Solution
This challenge focuses on debugging a Python script. When running the program, it immediately throws an error at **line 22: invalid syntax**.  
```bash
> python fixme2.py  
  File "/home/kali/Desktop/fixme2.py", line 22
    if flag = "":
       ^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?
```

In Python, conditional statements like if require the comparison operator `==` to test equality. 
The error at line 22 occurs because a single `=` is mistakenly used instead of `==`.
```python
if flag == "":
  print('String XOR encountered a problem, quitting.')
else:
  print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
```
Fixing this syntax mistake and rerunning the script reveals the flag.
```bash
> python fixme2.py  
That is correct! Here's your flag: picoCTF{3qu4l1ty_n0t_4551gnm3nt_4863e11b}
```

## 🚩Flag
> `picoCTF{3qu4l1ty_n0t_4551gnm3nt_4863e11b}`
