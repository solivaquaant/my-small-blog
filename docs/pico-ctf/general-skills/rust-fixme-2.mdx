# Rust fixme 2

- **Description:** The Rust saga continues? I ask you, can I borrow that, pleeeeeaaaasseeeee?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

---

## 🔎 Solution
After extracting the archive using `tar -xvf fixme2.tar.gz`, you'll find the following files in the directory:
- Cargo.toml
- Cargo.lock
- src/main.rs
Now try compiling and running the project with `cargo run`, you'll encounter the following error:
```
error[E0596]: cannot borrow `*borrowed_string` as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference
```
This error occurs at a line like `borrowed_string.push_str("...");`.
The issue here is that `borrowed_string` is an immutable reference (`&String`), which means you cannot modify the data it points to. 
The `.push_str()` method requires a mutable reference, because it alters the original String.

To resolve this, the function needs to accept a mutable reference (`&mut String`) instead.
Change this function signature:
```rust
fn decrypt(encrypted_buffer: Vec<u8>, borrowed_string: &String) { // How do we pass values to a function that we want to change?
```
to:
```rust
fn decrypt(encrypted_buffer: Vec<u8>, borrowed_string: &mut String) { 
```
Since we've updated the function to accept a `&mut` reference, we also need to modify the caller accordingly. 
In the main() function, change:
```rust
let party_foul = String::from("Using memory unsafe languages is a: "); // Is this variable changeable?
decrypt(encrypted_buffer, &party_foul); // Is this the correct way to pass a value to a function so that it can be changed?
```
to:
```rust
let mut party_foul = String::from("Using memory unsafe languages is a: "); 
decrypt(encrypted_buffer, &mut party_foul);
```
With these changes in place, recompile the project and this time, the program should run successfully and print the flag.
```

   Compiling rust_proj v0.1.0 (/home/kali/Desktop/pico-ctf/fixme2)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.34s
     Running `target/debug/rust_proj`
Using memory unsafe languages is a: PARTY FOUL! Here is your flag: picoCTF{4r3_y0u_h4v1n5_fun_y31?}
```
## 🔐 Key takeaways
- `&T` → Immutable reference: you cannot modify the data.
- `&mut T` → Mutable reference: you can modify the data.
- If a function needs to mutate a value, it must accept a &mut reference.
- The original variable must be declared as mut to be passed as mutable.
