# Trivial Flag Transfer Protocol

- **Description:** Figure out how they moved the flag.
- **Difficulty:** Medium

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After opening the pcap file in Wireshark, numerous packets using the TFTP protocol - a UDP-based file transfer protocol typically used in LAN environments-were observed.
To examine the transferred files, I navigated to **File â†’ Export Objects â†’ TFTP** and selected **Save All** to download all associated files.  

One of the exported files, `instructions.txt`, contained a string that appeared encoded. Using [this tool](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), I identified the encoding as **ROT-13**. 
```
GSGCQBRFAGRAPELCGBHEGENSSVPFBJRZHFGQVFTHVFRBHESYNTGENAFSRE.SVTHERBHGNJNLGBUVQRGURSYNTNAQVJVYYPURPXONPXSBEGURCYNA
```
Decoding it via [this](https://www.dcode.fr/rot-13-cipher) yielded the following message:
> "TFTP doesn't encrypt our traffic so we must disguise our flag transfer. Figure out a way to hide the flag and I will check back for the plan."

Another file, `plan`, also contained a ROT-13 encoded message. 
```
VHFRQGURCEBTENZNAQUVQVGJVGU-QHRQVYVTRAPR.PURPXBHGGURCUBGBF
```
Decoding it revealed:
> "I used the program and hid it with - duediligence. Check out the photos."

Besides `instructions.txt` and `plan`, the TFTP dump included 3 BMP image files and one `.deb` file. 
Based on the hint, the `.deb` file appeared to contain the tool used to hide the data.
```bash
> file program.deb
program.deb: Debian binary package (format 2.0), with control.tar.gz , data compression xz
```

Extracting the `.deb` file produced `control.tar.gz` and `data.tar.xz`.
```bash
> ar x program.deb 
```
From `control.tar.gz`, I extracted `md5sum` and `control`, both of which mentioned **steghide**, a tool for hiding and extracting data from images.
```bash                                                                                                                   
> tar -xvf control.tar.gz 
./
./md5sums
./control

> cat md5sums 
71bdab1263ab4b8d28f34afa5f0ab121  usr/bin/steghide
11db80c2a5dbb9c6107853b08aeacc49  usr/share/doc/steghide/ABOUT-NLS.gz
...
                                                                                                                      
> tar -xvf data.tar.xz   
./
./usr/
./usr/share/
./usr/share/doc/
./usr/share/doc/steghide/
./usr/share/doc/steghide/ABOUT-NLS.gz
...
```

Similarly, `data.tar.xz` also included references to steghide, reinforcing this clue.  

To retrieve the hidden data, I used **steghide**. 
According to the decoded plan message, the passphrase was likely **duediligence**.
`picture1.bmp` and `picture2.bmp` yielded no results. 
```bash
> steghide extract -sf picture1.bmp -p DUEDILIGENCE
steghide: could not extract any data with that passphrase!
                                                                                                                      
> steghide extract -sf picture2.bmp -p DUEDILIGENCE
steghide: could not extract any data with that passphrase!
```

However, `picture3.bmp` successfully revealed a hidden file: **flag.txt**, which contained the challenge flag.
```bash
> steghide extract -sf picture3.bmp -p DUEDILIGENCE
wrote extracted data to "flag.txt".
                                                                                                                      
> cat flag.txt 
picoCTF{h1dd3n_1n_pLa1n_51GHT_18375919}
```
