# Labs and experiments
Welcome to my **Digital playground**.

While CTF Write-ups are great for solving specific puzzles, this **Labs & experiments** section is dedicated to the broader aspect of Information Security and IT operations. 
This is where I build environments, simulate attacks, configure defenses, and document my personal research.

It is a place for "learning by doing" - building things from scratch and occasionally breaking them to understand how they work.

## What to expect?
I document my experiments across various domains:

### Blue team & defense
* **SIEM & monitoring:** Setting up and tuning tools like Splunk, Wazuh, or ELK Stack.
* **Threat hunting:** analyzing logs, configuring Sysmon, and writing detection rules.
* **Digital forensics:** Memory analysis, disk forensics, and artifact investigation.

### Red team & offensive security
* **Vulnerability research:** Analyzing CVEs (POCs) and understanding exploit chains.
* **Malware analysis:** Reverse engineering binaries and behavioral analysis in sandboxed environments.
* **Infrastructure:** Setting up C2 servers, phishing simulations, and Active Directory labs.

### DevOps & IT infrastructure
* **Hardening:** Securing Linux/Windows servers and Docker containers.
* **Automation:** Scripting with Python/Bash to automate security tasks.
* **Networking:** Packet analysis and network segmentation experiments.

## My philosophy
> *"You cannot defend what you do not understand."*

My goal is to demystify complex security concepts by implementing them in a controlled lab environment. 
Whether it's dissecting a piece of malware or hardening a web server, I believe in hands-on experience as the best teacher.
