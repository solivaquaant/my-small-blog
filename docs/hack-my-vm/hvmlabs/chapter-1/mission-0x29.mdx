# Mission 0x29

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting via SSH as *celeste*, the next hint points toward MySQL interaction.
```
celeste@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 0x29 #
################

## EN ##
The user celeste has access to mysql but for what?
```

Based on this hint, the current user should be able to authenticate into MySQL. 
Using the same username and password works:
```
mysql -uceleste -pVLSNMTKwSV2o8Tn
```

Once inside, listing the available databases reveals two:
```
MariaDB [(none)]> show databases;
+--------------------+
| Database           |
+--------------------+
| information_schema |
| venus              |
+--------------------+
```

Since `information_schema` is the system database, the focus shifts to the `venus` database:
```
MariaDB [(none)]> use venus;
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed
```

Inside this database, there is a single table named `people`:
```
MariaDB [venus]> show tables;
+-----------------+
| Tables_in_venus |
+-----------------+
| people          |
+-----------------+
```

Querying the table reveals the flag in row number 35:
```
+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------+
| id_people | uzer          | pazz                           |
+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------+
|        35 | haha          | 8===xKmPDsJSKpHLzkqKXyjx===D~~ |
+-----------+---------------+--------------------------------+
```

Unlike previous challenges, this mission doesn't mention any next target user in the `mission.txt`, which strongly suggests that the next passwords may also be hidden somewhere inside the database.

Looking back at patterns from previous stages, all valid passwords discovered so far were exactly 15 characters long. 
With that assumption, a filtered SQL query returns possible credentials for upcoming tasks:
```
MariaDB [venus]> SELECT * FROM people WHERE length(pazz) = 15;
+-----------+----------+-----------------+
| id_people | uzer     | pazz            |
+-----------+----------+-----------------+
|        16 | sfdfdsml | ixpeqdsfsdfdsfW |
|        44 | yuio     | ixpgbvcbvcbeqdW |
|        54 | crom     | ixpefdbvvcbrqdW |
|        58 | bael     | ixpesdvsdvsdqdW |
|        74 | nina     | ixpeqdWuvC5N9kG |
|        77 | dsar     | ixpeF43F3F34qdW |
|        78 | yop      | ixpeqdWCSDFDSFD |
|        79 | loco     | ixpeF43F34F3qdW |
+-----------+----------+-----------------+
```
Testing these entries showed that most of them didn't exist on the system - except for one: **nina**. 
So the next credential pair is clear:
- User: nina
- Password: ixpeqdWuvC5N9kG
Mission 0x30 continues with nina.
