# 040

## 🔎 Solution
After checking the content of the text file, I noticed it was filled with patterns of brackets, exclamation marks, and plus signs - definitely not normal text.
```
> cat 040.txt                 
[][(![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+(!![]+[])[+[]]][([][(![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+(!![]+[])[+[]]]+[])[!+[]+!+[]+!+[]]+(!![]+[][
```

To identify the format, I used an online [text identifier](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), and it quickly pointed to **JSFuck**, a JavaScript-based obfuscated encoding that only uses six characters.

Once identified, I ran the content through [a JSFuck decoder](https://www.dcode.fr/jsfuck-language), and it successfully revealed the flag.
