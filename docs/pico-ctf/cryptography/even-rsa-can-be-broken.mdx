# EVEN RSA CAN BE BROKEN???

- **Description:** This service provides you an encrypted flag. Can you decrypt it with just N & e?
- **Difficulty:** Easy

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
This challenge centers around the **[RSA algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/)**. 

We begin by recalling the fundamentals of RSA, including its key formulas and structure. 
RSA encryption uses a public key `(N, e)` and encrypts a message `M` into a ciphertext `C` using the equation:
```
C = M^e mod N
```
To decrypt and recover the original plaintext `M`, we need the private key exponent `d`, which satisfies:
```
M = C^d mod N
```
However, computing `d` requires knowing Euler's totient function `Ï†(N)`, which in turn depends on the prime factors `p` and `q` of `N`, since:
```
N = p * q
Ï†(N) = (p - 1)(q - 1)
```  

Upon connecting to the server, we are provided with `N`, `e`, and the ciphertext `C`.

```

A key insight in this challenge is that `N` is an **even** number. 
Since the product of 2 odd primes is always odd, the only way for `N` to be even is if one of the primes is 2. Thus, we deduce:
```
p = 2
q = N / 2
```
With both `p` and `q` known, we can compute `Ï†(N)`, derive the private exponent `d`, and ultimately decrypt the ciphertext to recover the original plaintext `M`.
Here I write a little script to solve the challenge:
```python
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes

N = 21037151367180372765283953053086158000036636729721345923644288910205211401496718658564665653657364950489341853920464418028274161652165537591176971735966138
e = 65537

q = N // 2
phi_N = q - 1
d = pow(e, -1, phi_N)

c = 6941187568627937171315289359497121515277569008096997024216911574186045398719488165082024925203613804200214707279648799387512395476391994412507744098543075
m = pow(c, d, N)
flag = long_to_bytes(m)
print(flag)
```
