## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge provides us with an APK file. 
When dealing with APK challenges, I typically start by extracting the contents as if it were a regular ZIP archive.

After inspecting the extracted files, I discovered a file located at `res/color/flag.txt`, which contains the following string:
``` 
7069636f4354467b6178386d433052553676655f4e5838356c346178386d436c5f61336562356163327d
```
Using a [text identification tool](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier), I determined that the string is encoded in **ASCII code**.

By decoding the string using [this tool](https://www.dcode.fr/ascii-code), I was able to retrieve the flag.
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./res.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
