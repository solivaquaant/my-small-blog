## ðŸ”Ž Solution
After extracting the archive, we obtain a directory named `drop-in`. 
Inside this folder, there is a `.txt` file and a hidden `.git` directory - indicating that this is the working directory of a Git repository, most likely cloned or initialized from GitHub.  
Next, we run the command `git log`. This command displays the commit history of the repository, showing detailed information such as the author, timestamp, and commit messages. 
And of course we have the flag~
```bash
> git log
