# Weak password

## ðŸ”Ž Solution
The challenge website presents a pop-up prompt for entering a username and password.

I started by inspecting the HTTP request using **Burp Suite** to check for anything suspicious in the headers. 
The only notable header was:
```
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=
```
The Base64 string  was simply the username:password I had entered.
Nothing's really helpful here.

Looking back at the challenge title, I decided to try a common credential pair: `admin:admin`. 
And just like that - it worked!

<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
  <img src={require("./flag.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>
## ðŸš©Flag
> `admin`
