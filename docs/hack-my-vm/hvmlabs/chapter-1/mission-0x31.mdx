# Mission 0x31

## 🔎 Solution
After connecting as *kira*, the next step points to another web-based hint.
```
kira@venus:~$ cat mission.txt 
################
# MISSION 31 #
################

## EN ##
The user veronica visits a lot http://localhost/waiting.php
```

Accessing the given URL returns a message instead of a password:
```
kira@venus:~$ curl http://localhost/waiting.php

Im waiting for the user-agent PARADISE.
```

This suggests the server is checking the request headers - specifically the `User-Agent`. 
A User-Agent string is normally used by browsers or tools to identify themselves when communicating over HTTP. 
Since the message explicitly mentions `PARADISE`, it makes sense to include it as the User-Agent value.

Doing so reveals the next password:
```
kira@venus:~$ curl -A PARADISE http://localhost/waiting.php 

QTOel6BodTx2cwX
```

With the new password, SSH access to the next user becomes possible:
```
ssh veronica@venus.hackmyvm.eu -p 5000
```

Once logged in, retrieving the usual file exposes the flag:
```
veronica@venus:~$ cat flagz.txt 
8===iSSeKzoDXsKy8WPuqNPg===D~~
```

## 🚩Flag
> `8===iSSeKzoDXsKy8WPuqNPg===D~~`
